\v 1 O the blessedness of that one, || Who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, || And has not stood in the way of sinners, || And has not sat in the seat of scorners;
\v 2 But his delight [is] in the Law of YHWH, || And in His law he meditates by day and by night:
\v 3 And he has been as a tree, || Planted by streams of water, || That gives its fruit in its season, || And its leaf does not wither, || And all that he does he causes to prosper.
\v 4 Not so the wicked: But [they are] as chaff that wind drives away!
\v 5 Therefore the wicked do not rise in judgment, || Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous,
\v 6 For YHWH is knowing the way of the righteous, || And the way of the wicked is lost!
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Why have nations assembled tumultuously? And peoples meditate vanity?
\v 2 Kings of the earth station themselves, and princes have been united together, against YHWH, and against His Messiah:
\v 3 “Let us draw off Their cords, || And cast Their thick bands from us.”
\v 4 He who is sitting in the heavens laughs, || The Lord mocks at them.
\v 5 Then He speaks to them in His anger, and in His wrath He troubles them:
\v 6 “And I have anointed My King, || On Zion—My holy hill.”
\v 7 I declare concerning a statute: YHWH said to me, “You [are] My Son, today I have brought You forth.
\v 8 Ask of Me and I give nations [as] Your inheritance, || And the ends of the earth [for] Your possession.
\v 9 You rule them with a scepter of iron, || You crush them as a vessel of a potter.”
\v 10 And now, O kings, act wisely, || Be instructed, O judges of earth,
\v 11 Serve YHWH with fear, || And rejoice with trembling.
\v 12 Kiss the Chosen One \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* Son\bd ]]\bd*, lest He is angry, || And you perish [from] the way, || When His anger burns but a little, || O the blessedness of all trusting in Him!

\v 1 A PSALM OF DAVID, IN HIS FLEEING FROM THE FACE OF HIS SON ABSALOM. YHWH, how my distresses have multiplied! Many are rising up against me.
\v 2 Many are saying of my soul, “There is no salvation for him in God.” Selah.
\v 3 And You, O YHWH, [are] a shield for me, || My glory, and lifter up of my head.
\v 4 My voice [is] to YHWH: I call and He answers me from His holy hill, Selah.
\v 5 I have lain down, and I sleep, || I have awoken, for YHWH sustains me.
\v 6 I am not afraid of myriads of people, || That they have set against me all around.
\v 7 Rise, O YHWH! Save me, my God! For You have struck all my enemies [on] the cheek. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.
\v 8 This salvation [is] of YHWH; Your blessing [is] on Your people! Selah.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. A PSALM OF DAVID. In my calling answer me, || O God of my righteousness. In adversity You gave enlargement to me; Favor me, and hear my prayer.
\v 2 Sons of men! Until when [is] my glory for shame? You love a vain thing, you seek a lie. Selah.
\v 3 And know that YHWH || Has separated a saintly one to Himself. YHWH hears in my calling to Him.
\v 4 “Tremble, and do not sin”; Say [thus] in your heart on your bed, || And be silent. Selah.
\v 5 Sacrifice sacrifices of righteousness, || And trust in YHWH.
\v 6 Many are saying, “Who shows us good?” Lift on us the light of Your face, O YHWH,
\v 7 You have given joy in my heart, || From the time their grain and their wine || Have been multiplied.
\v 8 Together I lie down and sleep in peace, || For You, O YHWH, alone, || Cause me to dwell in confidence!
\c 5
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. [BLOWN] INTO THE PIPES. A PSALM OF DAVID. Hear my sayings, O YHWH, || Consider my meditation.
\v 2 Be attentive to the voice of my cry, || My King and my God, || For I pray to You habitually.
\v 3 YHWH, [in] the morning You hear my voice, || [In] the morning I set in array for You, || And I look out [expectantly].
\v 4 For You [are] not a God desiring wickedness, || Evil does not inhabit You.
\v 5 The boastful do not station themselves before Your eyes: You have hated all working iniquity.
\v 6 You destroy those speaking lies, || YHWH detests a man of blood and deceit.
\v 7 And I, in the abundance of Your kindness, || I enter Your house, || I bow myself toward Your holy temple in Your fear.
\v 8 O YHWH, lead me in Your righteousness, || Because of those observing me, || Make Your way straight before me,
\v 9 For there is no stability in their mouth. Their heart [is] mischiefs, || Their throat [is] an open grave, || They make their tongue smooth.
\v 10 Declare them guilty, O God, || Let them fall from their own counsels, || In the abundance of their transgressions || Drive them away, || Because they have been rebellious against You.
\v 11 And all trusting in You rejoice, || They sing for all time, and You cover them over, || And those loving Your Name exult in You.
\v 12 For You bless the righteous, O YHWH, || Surrounding him with favor as a buckler!
\c 6
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS, ON THE EIGHTH. A PSALM OF DAVID. O YHWH, do not reprove me in Your anger, || Nor discipline me in Your fury.
\v 2 Favor me, O YHWH, for I [am] weak, || Heal me, O YHWH, || For my bones have been troubled,
\v 3 And my soul has been troubled greatly, || And You, O YHWH, until when?
\v 4 Turn back, O YHWH, draw out my soul, || Save me for Your kindness’ sake.
\v 5 For in death there is no memorial of You, || In Sheol, who gives thanks to You?
\v 6 I have been weary with my sighing, || I meditate [on] my bed through all the night, || I dissolve my couch with my tear.
\v 7 My eye is old from provocation, || It is old because of all my adversaries,
\v 8 Turn from me all you workers of iniquity, || For YHWH heard the voice of my weeping,
\v 9 YHWH has heard my supplication, || YHWH receives my prayer.
\v 10 All my enemies are greatly ashamed and troubled, || They turn back—ashamed [in] a moment!
\c 7
\p
\v 1 A SHIGGAION OF DAVID, THAT HE SUNG TO YHWH CONCERNING THE WORDS OF CUSH, A BENJAMITE. O YHWH, my God, in You I have trusted, || Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me.
\v 2 Lest he tear my soul as a lion, || Tearing, and there is no deliverer.
\v 3 O YHWH, my God, if I have done this, || If there is iniquity in my hands,
\v 4 If I have done my well-wisher evil, || And draw my adversary without cause,
\v 5 [Then] an enemy pursues my soul, and overtakes, || And treads down my life to the earth, || And places my glory in the dust. Selah.
\v 6 Rise, O YHWH, in Your anger, || Be lifted up at the wrath of my adversaries, || And awake Yourself for me: You have commanded judgment.
\v 7 And a congregation of peoples surround You, || And over it turn back on high.
\v 8 YHWH judges the peoples; Judge me, O YHWH, || According to my righteousness, || And according to my integrity [that is] on me.
\v 9 Please let the evil of the wicked be ended, || And establish the righteous, || And a trier of hearts and reins is the righteous God.
\v 10 My shield [is] on God, || Savior of the upright in heart!
\v 11 God [is] judging right, || And He is not angry at all times.
\v 12 If [one] does not turn, || He sharpens His sword, || He has bent His bow [and] He prepares it,
\v 13 Indeed, He has prepared for Himself || Instruments of death, || He makes His arrows for burning pursuers.
\v 14 Behold, he travails [with] iniquity, || And he has conceived perverseness, || And has brought forth falsehood.
\v 15 He has prepared a pit, and he digs it, || And he falls into a ditch he makes.
\v 16 His perverseness returns on his head, || And his violence comes down on his crown.
\v 17 I thank YHWH, || According to His righteousness, || And I praise the Name of YHWH Most High!
\c 8
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. ON THE GITTITH. A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH, our Lord, || How majestic [is] Your Name in all the earth, || Who have set Your splendor on the heavens!
\v 2 From the mouths of infants and sucklings || You have founded strength, || Because of Your adversaries, || To still an enemy and a self-avenger.
\v 3 For I see Your heavens, a work of Your fingers, || [The] moon and stars that You established.
\v 4 What [is] man that You remember him? The son of man that You inspect him?
\v 5 You make him a little lower than the gods \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* God\bd ]]\bd*, || And surround him with glory and majesty.
\v 6 You cause him to rule || Over the works of Your hands, || You have placed all under his feet.
\v 7 Sheep and oxen, all of them, || And also beasts of the field,
\v 8 Bird of the heavens, and fish of the sea, || Passing through the paths of the seas!
\v 9 YHWH, our Lord, || How majestic [is] Your Name in all the earth!
\c 9
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. [SET] ON “DEATH OF THE SON.” A PSALM OF DAVID. I confess, O YHWH, with all my heart, || I recount all Your wonders,
\v 2 I rejoice and exult in You, || I praise Your Name, O Most High.
\v 3 In my enemies turning backward, || They stumble and perish from Your face.
\v 4 For You have done my judgment and my right. You have sat on a throne, || Judging [with] righteousness.
\v 5 You have rebuked nations, || You have destroyed the wicked, || You have blotted out their name for all time and forever.
\v 6 The enemy—[your] destructions have been completed forever, || As for cities you have plucked up, || Their memorial has perished with them.
\v 7 And YHWH abides for all time, || He is preparing His throne for judgment.
\v 8 And He judges the world in righteousness, || He judges the peoples in uprightness.
\v 9 And YHWH is a tower for the bruised, || A tower for times of adversity.
\v 10 They trust in You who know Your Name, || For You have not forsaken those seeking You, O YHWH.
\v 11 Sing praise to YHWH, inhabiting Zion, || Declare His acts among the peoples,
\v 12 For He who is seeking for blood || Has remembered them, || He has not forgotten the cry of the afflicted.
\v 13 Favor me, O YHWH, || See my affliction by those hating me, || You who lift me up from the gates of death,
\v 14 So that I recount all Your praise, || In the gates of the daughter of Zion. I rejoice on Your salvation.
\v 15 Nations have sunk in a pit they made, || Their foot has been captured in a net that they hid.
\v 16 YHWH has been known, || He has done judgment; By a work of his hands || The wicked has been snared. Meditation. Selah.
\v 17 The wicked turn back to Sheol, || All nations forgetting God.
\v 18 For the needy is not forgotten forever, || [Nor] the hope of the humble lost for all time.
\v 19 Rise, O YHWH, do not let man be strong, || Let nations be judged before Your face.
\v 20 Appoint them to fear, O YHWH, || Let nations know they [are] men! Selah.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Why, YHWH, do You stand at a distance? Do You hide in times of adversity?
\v 2 Through the pride of the wicked, || Is the poor inflamed, || They are caught in schemes that they devised.
\v 3 Because the wicked has boasted || Of the desire of his soul, || And he has blessed a dishonest gainer, || He has despised YHWH.
\v 4 The wicked does not inquire according to the height of his face. “There is no God!” [are] all his schemes.
\v 5 His ways writhe at all times, || Your judgments [are] on high before him, || All his adversaries—he puffs at them.
\v 6 He has said in his heart, “I am not moved, || [And am] not in calamity to generation and generation.”
\v 7 His mouth is full of oaths, || And deceits, and fraud: Under his tongue [is] perverseness and iniquity,
\v 8 He sits in an ambush of the villages, || He slays the innocent in secret places. His eyes secretly watch for the afflicted,
\v 9 He lies in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert. He lies in wait to catch the poor, || He catches the poor, drawing him into his net.
\v 10 He is bruised—he bows down, || The afflicted has fallen by his mighty ones.
\v 11 He said in his heart, “God has forgotten, || He has hid His face, || He has never seen.”
\v 12 Arise, O YHWH! O God, lift up Your hand! Do not forget the humble.
\v 13 Why has the wicked despised God? He has said in his heart, “It is not required.”
\v 14 You have seen, || For You behold perverseness and anger; By giving into Your hand, || The afflicted leave [it] on You, || You have been a helper of the fatherless.
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, || Seek out his wickedness, find none;
\v 16 YHWH [is] King for all time and forever, || The nations have perished out of His land!
\v 17 You have heard the desire of the humble, O YHWH. You prepare their heart; You cause Your ear to attend,
\v 18 To judge the fatherless and bruised: He adds no more to oppress—man of the earth!
\c 11
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. BY DAVID. In YHWH I trusted, how do you say to my soul, “They moved to your mountain [as] the bird?”
\v 2 For behold, the wicked bend a bow, || They have prepared their arrow on the string, || To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
\v 3 When the foundations are destroyed, || The righteous—what has he done?
\v 4 YHWH [is] in His holy temple: YHWH—His throne [is] in the heavens. His eyes see—His eyelids try the sons of men.
\v 5 YHWH tries the righteous. And the wicked and the lover of violence, || His soul has hated,
\v 6 He pours on the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone, || And a horrible wind [is] the portion of their cup.
\v 7 For YHWH [is] righteous, || He has loved righteousness, || His countenance sees the upright!
\c 12
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. ON THE EIGHTH. A PSALM OF DAVID. Save, YHWH, for the saintly has failed, || For the steadfast have ceased || From the sons of men:
\v 2 They each speak vanity with his neighbor, || Lip of flattery! With heart and heart they speak.
\v 3 YHWH cuts off all lips of flattery, || A tongue speaking great things,
\v 4 Who said, “By our tongue we do mightily: Our lips [are] our own; who [is] lord over us?”
\v 5 Because of the spoiling of the poor, || Because of the groaning of the needy, || Now I arise, says YHWH, || I set in safety [him who] breathes for it.
\v 6 Sayings of YHWH [are] pure sayings—Silver tried in a furnace of earth, refined sevenfold.
\v 7 You, O YHWH, preserve them, || You keep us from this generation for all time.
\v 8 The wicked walk around continually, || According as vileness is exalted by sons of men!
\c 13
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. Until when, O YHWH, || Do You forget me forever? Until when do You hide Your face from me?
\v 2 Until when do I set counsels in my soul, || [With] sorrow in my heart daily? Until when is my enemy exalted over me?
\v 3 Look attentively; Answer me, O YHWH, my God, || Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep in death,
\v 4 Lest my enemy say, “I overcame him,” || My adversaries rejoice when I am moved.
\v 5 And I have trusted in Your kindness, || My heart rejoices in Your salvation.
\v 6 I sing to YHWH, || For He has conferred benefits on me!
\c 14
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. BY DAVID. A fool has said in his heart, “There is no God”; They have done corruptly, || They have done abominable actions, || There is not a doer of good.
\v 2 YHWH has looked from the heavens on the sons of men, || To see if there is a wise one—seeking God.
\v 3 The whole have turned aside, || Together they have been filthy: There is not a doer of good, not even one.
\v 4 Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my people have eaten bread, || They have not called YHWH.
\v 5 They have feared a fear there, || For God [is] in the generation of the righteous.
\v 6 You cause the counsel of the poor to stink, || Because YHWH [is] his refuge.
\v 7 “Who gives the salvation of Israel from Zion?” When YHWH turns back || [To] a captivity of His people, || Jacob rejoices—Israel is glad!
\c 15
\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH, who sojourns in Your tent? Who dwells in Your holy hill?
\v 2 He who is walking uprightly, || And working righteousness, || And speaking truth in his heart.
\v 3 He has not slandered by his tongue, || He has not done evil to his friend; And he has not lifted up reproach || Against his neighbor.
\v 4 A rejected one [is] despised in his eyes, || And he honors those fearing YHWH. He has sworn to endure evil, and does not change;
\v 5 He has not given his silver in usury, || And has not taken a bribe against the innocent; Whoever is doing these is not moved for all time!
\c 16
\p
\v 1 A MIKTAM OF DAVID. Preserve me, O God, for I trusted in You.
\v 2 You have said to YHWH, “You [are] my Lord”; My goodness [is] not above You;
\v 3 For the holy ones who [are] in the land, || And the honorable, all my delight [is] in them.
\v 4 Their griefs are multiplied, [who] have hurried backward; I do not pour out their drink-offerings of blood, || Nor do I take up their names on my lips.
\v 5 YHWH [is] the portion of my share, and of my cup, || You uphold my lot.
\v 6 Lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, || Indeed, a beautiful inheritance [is] for me.
\v 7 I bless YHWH who has counseled me; Also [in] the nights my reins instruct me.
\v 8 I placed YHWH before me continually, || Because [He is] at my right hand I am not moved.
\v 9 Therefore my heart has been glad, || And my glory rejoices, || Also my flesh dwells confidently:
\v 10 For You do not leave my soul to Sheol, || Nor give your Holy One to see corruption.
\v 11 You cause me to know the path of life; In Your presence [is] fullness of joys, || Pleasant things [are] by Your right hand forever!
\c 17
\p
\v 1 A PRAYER OF DAVID. Hear, O YHWH, righteousness, attend my cry, || Give ear [to] my prayer, without lips of deceit.
\v 2 My judgment goes out from before You; Your eyes see uprightly.
\v 3 You have proved my heart, || You have inspected by night, || You have tried me, You find nothing; My thoughts do not pass over my mouth.
\v 4 As for doings of man, || Through a word of Your lips I have observed || The paths of a destroyer;
\v 5 To uphold my goings in Your paths, || My steps have not slipped.
\v 6 I called You, for You answer me, || O God, incline Your ear to me, hear my speech.
\v 7 Separate Your kindness wonderfully, O Savior of the confiding, || By Your right hand, from withstanders.
\v 8 Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye; Hide me in the shadow of Your wings,
\v 9 From the face of the wicked who spoiled me, || [From] my enemies in soul who go around against me.
\v 10 They have closed up their fat, || Their mouths have spoken with pride:
\v 11 “Our steps have now surrounded [him]”; They set their eyes to turn aside in the land.
\v 12 His likeness as a lion desirous to tear, || As a young lion dwelling in secret places.
\v 13 Arise, O YHWH, go before his face, || Cause him to bend. Deliver my soul from the wicked, Your sword,
\v 14 From men, Your hand, O YHWH, || From men of the world, their portion [is] in life, || And [with] Your hidden things You fill their belly, || They are satisfied [with] sons, || And have left their abundance to their sucklings.
\v 15 I—in righteousness, || I see Your face; I am satisfied, in awaking, [with] Your form!
\c 18
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. BY A SERVANT OF YHWH, BY DAVID, WHO HAS SPOKEN TO YHWH THE WORDS OF THIS SONG IN THE DAY YHWH DELIVERED HIM FROM THE HAND OF ALL HIS ENEMIES, AND FROM THE HAND OF SAUL, AND HE SAYS: I love You, O YHWH, my strength.
\v 2 YHWH [is] my rock, and my bulwark, || And my deliverer, || My God [is] my rock, || I trust in Him: My shield, and the horn of my salvation, || My high tower.
\v 3 I call on YHWH, the Praised One, || And I am saved from my enemies.
\v 4 Cords of death have surrounded me, || And streams of the worthless make me afraid.
\v 5 Cords of Sheol have surrounded me, || Snares of death have been before me.
\v 6 In my adversity I call YHWH, || And I cry to my God. He hears my voice from His temple, || And My cry comes into His ears before Him.
\v 7 And the earth shakes and trembles, || And foundations of hills are troubled, || And they shake—because He has wrath.
\v 8 Smoke has gone up from His nostrils, || And fire from His mouth consumes, || Coals have been kindled by it.
\v 9 And He inclines the heavens, and comes down, || And thick darkness [is] under His feet.
\v 10 And He rides on a cherub, and flies, || And He flies on wings of wind.
\v 11 He makes darkness His secret place, || Around Him His dwelling place, || Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
\v 12 From the brightness before Him His thick clouds have passed on, || Hail and coals of fire.
\v 13 And YHWH thunders in the heavens, || And the Most High gives forth His voice, || Hail and coals of fire.
\v 14 And He sends His arrows and scatters them, || And much lightning, and crushes them.
\v 15 And the streams of waters are seen, || And foundations of the earth are revealed, || From Your rebuke, O YHWH, || From the breath of the wind of Your anger.
\v 16 He sends from above—He takes me, || He draws me out of many waters.
\v 17 He delivers me from my strong enemy, || And from those hating me, || For they have been stronger than I.
\v 18 They go before me in a day of my calamity || And YHWH is for a support to me.
\v 19 And He brings me forth to a large place, || He draws me out, because He delighted in me.
\v 20 YHWH repays me || According to my righteousness, || According to the cleanness of my hands, || He returns to me.
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of YHWH, || And have not done wickedly against my God.
\v 22 For all His judgments [are] before me, || And I do not turn His statutes from me.
\v 23 And I am perfect with Him, || And I keep myself from my iniquity.
\v 24 And YHWH returns to me, || According to my righteousness, || According to the cleanness of my hands, || Before His eyes.
\v 25 With the kind You show Yourself kind, || With a perfect man You show Yourself perfect.
\v 26 With the pure You show Yourself pure, || And with the perverse You show Yourself a wrestler,
\v 27 For You save a poor people, || And cause the eyes of the high to fall.
\v 28 For You light my lamp, || My God YHWH enlightens my darkness.
\v 29 For by You I run [against] a troop! And by my God I leap a wall.
\v 30 God—perfect [is] His way, || The saying of YHWH is tried, || He [is] a shield to all those trusting in Him.
\v 31 For who [is] God besides YHWH? And who [is] a rock except our God?
\v 32 God—who is girding me [with] strength, || And He makes my way perfect.
\v 33 Making my feet like does, || And on my high places causes me to stand.
\v 34 Teaching my hands for battle, || And a bow of bronze was brought down by my arms.
\v 35 And You give to me the shield of Your salvation, || And Your right hand supports me, || And Your lowliness makes me great.
\v 36 You enlarge my step under me, || And my ankles have not slipped.
\v 37 I pursue my enemies, and overtake them, || And do not turn back until they are consumed.
\v 38 I strike them, and they are not able to rise, || They fall under my feet,
\v 39 And You gird me [with] strength for battle, || You cause my withstanders to bow under me.
\v 40 As for my enemies—You have given to me the neck, || As for those hating me—I cut them off.
\v 41 They cry, and there is no savior, || On YHWH, and He does not answer them.
\v 42 And I beat them as dust before wind, || I empty them out as mire of the streets.
\v 43 You deliver me || From the strivings of the people, || You place me for a head of nations, || A people I have not known serve me.
\v 44 At the hearing of the ear they listen to me, || Sons of a stranger feign obedience to me,
\v 45 Sons of a stranger fade away, || And are slain out of their close places.
\v 46 YHWH lives—and blessed [is] my rock, || And exalted is the God of my salvation.
\v 47 God—who is giving vengeance to me, || And He subdues peoples under me,
\v 48 My deliverer from my enemies, || You raise me above my withstanders, || Deliver me from a man of violence.
\v 49 Therefore I confess You among nations, O YHWH, || And I sing praise to Your Name,
\v 50 Magnifying the salvation of His king, || And doing kindness to His anointed, || To David, and to his seed—for all time!
\c 19
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. The heavens [are] recounting the glory of God, || And the expanse [is] declaring the work of His hands.
\v 2 Day to day utters speech, || And night to night shows knowledge.
\v 3 There is no speech, and there are no words. Their voice has not been heard.
\v 4 Their line has gone forth into all the earth, || And their sayings to the end of the world, || In them He placed a tent for the sun,
\v 5 And he, as a bridegroom, goes out from his covering, || He rejoices as a mighty one || To run the path.
\v 6 From the end of the heavens [is] his going out, || And his revolution [is] to their ends, || And nothing is hid from his heat.
\v 7 The law of YHWH [is] perfect, refreshing the soul, || The testimonies of YHWH [are] steadfast, || Making the simple wise,
\v 8 The precepts of YHWH [are] upright, || Rejoicing the heart, || The command of YHWH [is] pure, enlightening the eyes,
\v 9 The fear of YHWH [is] clean, standing for all time, || The judgments of YHWH [are] true, || They have been righteous—together.
\v 10 They are more desirable than gold, || Indeed, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, || Even liquid honey of the comb.
\v 11 Also—Your servant is warned by them, “In keeping them [is] a great reward.”
\v 12 [His] errors—who understands? Declare me innocent from hidden ones,
\v 13 Also—keep back Your servant from presumptuous ones, || Do not let them rule over me, || Then I am perfect, || And declared innocent of much transgression.
\v 14 Let the sayings of my mouth, || And the meditation of my heart, || Be for a pleasing thing before You, || O YHWH, my rock, and my redeemer!
\c 20
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH answers you, || In a day of adversity, || The Name of the God of Jacob sets you on high,
\v 2 He sends your help from the sanctuary, || And supports you from Zion,
\v 3 He remembers all your presents, || And reduces your burnt-offering to ashes. Selah.
\v 4 He gives to you according to your heart, || And fulfills all your counsel.
\v 5 We sing of Your salvation, || And in the Name of our God set up a banner. YHWH fulfills all your requests.
\v 6 Now I have known || That YHWH has saved His anointed, || He answers him from His holy heavens, || With the saving might of His right hand.
\v 7 Some of chariots, and some of horses, || And we of the Name of our God YHWH || Make mention.
\v 8 They have bowed and have fallen, || And we have risen and station ourselves upright.
\v 9 O YHWH, save the king, || He answers us in the day we call!
\c 21
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH, the king is joyful in Your strength, || How greatly he rejoices in Your salvation.
\v 2 You gave the desire of his heart to him, || And You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
\v 3 For You put blessings of goodness before him, || You set a crown of fine gold on his head.
\v 4 He has asked for life from You, || You have given length of days to him, || For all time and forever.
\v 5 Great [is] his glory in Your salvation, || You place splendor and majesty on him.
\v 6 For You make him blessings forever, || You cause him to rejoice with joy, || By Your countenance.
\v 7 For the king is trusting in YHWH, || And in the kindness of the Most High he is not moved.
\v 8 Your hand comes to all Your enemies, || Your right hand finds Your haters.
\v 9 You make them as a furnace of fire, || At the time of Your presence. YHWH swallows them in His anger, || And fire devours them.
\v 10 You destroy their fruit from earth, || And their seed from the sons of men.
\v 11 For they stretched out evil against You, || They devised a wicked scheme, they do not prevail,
\v 12 For You make them turn their back, || When You prepare Your strings against their faces.
\v 13 Be exalted, O YHWH, in Your strength, || We sing and we praise Your might!
\c 22
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. [SET] ON “DOE OF THE MORNING.” A PSALM OF DAVID. My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? Far from My salvation, || The words of My roaring?
\v 2 My God, I call by day, and You do not answer, || And by night, and am not silent.
\v 3 And You [are] holy, || Sitting—the Praise of Israel.
\v 4 In You our fathers trusted; They trusted, and You deliver them.
\v 5 To You they cried, and were delivered, || In You they trusted, and were not disappointed.
\v 6 And I [am] a worm, and no man, || A reproach of man, and despised of the people.
\v 7 All beholding Me mock at Me, || They make free with the lip—shake the head,
\v 8 “Roll to YHWH, He delivers Him, || He delivers Him, for He delighted in Him.”
\v 9 For You [are] He bringing Me forth from the womb, || Causing Me to trust, || On the breasts of My mother.
\v 10 On You I have been cast from the womb, || From the belly of My mother You [are] My God.
\v 11 Do not be far from Me, || For adversity is near, for there is no helper.
\v 12 Many bulls have surrounded Me, || Mighty ones of Bashan have surrounded Me,
\v 13 They have opened their mouth against Me, || A lion tearing and roaring.
\v 14 I have been poured out as waters, || And all my bones have separated themselves, || My heart has been like wax, || It is melted in the midst of My bowels.
\v 15 My power is dried up as an earthen vessel, || And My tongue is cleaving to My jaws.
\v 16 And You appoint Me to the dust of death, || For dogs have surrounded Me, || A company of evildoers has surrounded Me, || Piercing My hands and My feet.
\v 17 I count all My bones—they look expectingly, || They look on Me,
\v 18 They apportion My garments to themselves, || And they cause a lot to fall for My clothing.
\v 19 And You, O YHWH, do not be far off, || O My strength, hurry to help Me.
\v 20 Deliver My soul from the sword, || My only one from the paw of a dog.
\v 21 Save Me from the mouth of a lion || And You have answered Me from the horns of the high places!
\v 22 I declare Your Name to My brothers, || In the midst of the assembly I praise You.
\v 23 You who fear YHWH, praise Him, || All the seed of Jacob, honor Him, || And be afraid of Him, all you seed of Israel.
\v 24 For He has not despised, nor detested, || The affliction of the afflicted, || Nor has He hidden His face from Him, || And in His crying to Him He hears.
\v 25 Of You My praise [is] in the great assembly. I complete My vows before His fearers.
\v 26 The humble eat and are satisfied, || Those seeking Him praise YHWH, || Your heart lives forever.
\v 27 Remember and return to YHWH, || Do all the ends of the earth, || And bow themselves before You, || Do all families of the nations,
\v 28 For to YHWH [is] the kingdom, || And He is ruling among nations.
\v 29 And the fat ones of earth have eaten, || And they bow themselves, || All going down to dust bow before Him, || And he [who] has not revived his soul.
\v 30 A seed serves Him, || It is declared of the Lord to the generation.
\v 31 They come and declare His righteousness, || To a people that is born, that He has made!
\c 23
\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH [is] my shepherd, I do not lack,
\v 2 He causes me to lie down in pastures of tender grass, || He leads me by quiet waters.
\v 3 He refreshes my soul, || He leads me in paths of righteousness || For His Name’s sake;
\v 4 Also—when I walk in a valley of death-shade, || I fear no evil, for You [are] with me, || Your rod and Your staff—they comfort me.
\v 5 You arrange a table before me, || In front of my adversaries, || You have anointed my head with oil, || My cup is full!
\v 6 Surely goodness and kindness pursue me || All the days of my life, || And my dwelling [is] in the house of YHWH, || For [the] length of [my] days!
\c 24
\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF DAVID. To YHWH [is] the earth and its fullness, || The world and the inhabitants in it.
\v 2 For He has founded it on the seas, || And He establishes it on the floods.
\v 3 Who goes up into the hill of YHWH? And who rises up in His holy place?
\v 4 The clean of hands, and pure of heart, || Who has not lifted up his soul to vanity, || Nor has sworn to deceit.
\v 5 He carries away a blessing from YHWH, || Righteousness from the God of his salvation.
\v 6 This [is] a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Your face, O Jacob! Selah.
\v 7 Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O perpetual doors! And the King of Glory comes in!
\v 8 Who [is] this—“the King of Glory?” YHWH—strong and mighty, || YHWH, the mighty in battle.
\v 9 Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O perpetual doors! And the King of Glory comes in!
\v 10 Who [is] He—this “King of Glory?” YHWH of hosts—He [is] the King of Glory! Selah.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 BY DAVID. [ALEPH-BET] To You, O YHWH, I lift up my soul.
\v 2 My God, in You I have trusted, || Do not let me be ashamed, || Do not let my enemies exult over me.
\v 3 Also let none waiting on You be ashamed, || Let the treacherous dealers without cause be ashamed.
\v 4 Your ways, O YHWH, cause me to know, || You teach me Your paths.
\v 5 Cause me to tread in Your truth, and teach me, || For You [are] the God of my salvation, || Near You I have waited all the day.
\v 6 Remember Your mercies, O YHWH, || And Your kindnesses, for they [are] from the age.
\v 7 Sins of my youth, and my transgressions, || Do not remember. According to Your kindness be mindful of me, || For Your goodness’ sake, O YHWH.
\v 8 Good and upright [is] YHWH, || Therefore He directs sinners in the way.
\v 9 He causes the humble to tread in judgment, || And teaches the humble His way.
\v 10 All the paths of YHWH [are] kindness and truth, || To those keeping His covenant, || And His testimonies.
\v 11 For Your Name’s sake, O YHWH, || You have pardoned my iniquity, for it [is] great.
\v 12 Who [is] this—the man fearing YHWH? He directs him in the way He chooses.
\v 13 His soul remains in good, || And his seed possesses the land.
\v 14 The secret of YHWH [is] for those fearing Him, || And His covenant—to cause them to know.
\v 15 My eyes [are] continually to YHWH, || For He brings my feet out from a net.
\v 16 Turn to me, and favor me, || For I [am] lonely and afflicted.
\v 17 The distresses of my heart have enlarged themselves, || Bring me out from my distresses.
\v 18 See my affliction and my misery, || And bear with all my sins.
\v 19 See my enemies, for they have been many, || And they have hated me with violent hatred.
\v 20 Keep my soul, and deliver me, || Do not let me be ashamed, for I trusted in You.
\v 21 Integrity and uprightness keep me, || For I have waited [on] You.
\v 22 Redeem Israel, O God, from all his distresses!
\c 26
\p
\v 1 BY DAVID. Judge me, O YHWH, for I have walked in my integrity, || And I have trusted in YHWH, || I do not slide.
\v 2 Try me, O YHWH, and prove me, || My reins and my heart [are] purified,
\v 3 For Your kindness [is] before my eyes, || And I have habitually walked in Your truth.
\v 4 I have not sat with vain men, || And I do not enter with pretenders.
\v 5 I have hated the assembly of evildoers, || And I do not sit with the wicked.
\v 6 I wash my hands in innocence, || And I go around Your altar, O YHWH.
\v 7 To sound with a voice of confession, || And to recount all Your wonders.
\v 8 YHWH, I have loved the habitation of Your house, || And the place of the Dwelling Place of Your glory.
\v 9 Do not gather my soul with sinners, || And my life with men of blood,
\v 10 In whose hand [is] a wicked scheme, || And their right hand [is] full of bribes.
\v 11 And I walk in my integrity, || Redeem me, and favor me.
\v 12 My foot has stood in uprightness, || In assemblies I bless YHWH!
\c 27
\p
\v 1 BY DAVID. YHWH [is] my light and my salvation, || Whom do I fear? YHWH [is] the strength of my life, || Of whom am I afraid?
\v 2 When evildoers come near to me to eat my flesh, || My adversaries and my enemies to me, || They have stumbled and fallen.
\v 3 Though a host encamps against me, || My heart does not fear, || Though war rises up against me, || In this I [am] confident.
\v 4 One [thing] I asked of YHWH—it I seek: My dwelling in the house of YHWH, || All the days of my life, || To look on the pleasantness of YHWH, || And to inquire in His temple.
\v 5 For He hides me in a dwelling place in the day of evil, || He hides me in a secret place of His tent, || He raises me up on a rock.
\v 6 And now my head is lifted up, || Above my enemies—my surrounders, || And I sacrifice in His tent sacrifices of shouting, || I sing, indeed, I sing praise to YHWH.
\v 7 Hear, O YHWH, my voice—I call, || And favor me, and answer me.
\v 8 My heart said to You, “They sought my face, || Your face, O YHWH, I seek.”
\v 9 Do not hide Your face from me, || Do not turn Your servant aside in anger, || You have been my help. Do not leave me, nor forsake me, || O God of my salvation.
\v 10 When my father and my mother || Have forsaken me, then YHWH gathers me.
\v 11 Show me, O YHWH, Your way, || And lead me in a path of uprightness, || For the sake of my beholders.
\v 12 Do not give me to the will of my adversaries, || For false witnesses have risen against me, || And they breathe out violence to me.
\v 13 I had not believed to look on the goodness of YHWH || In the land of the living!
\v 14 Look to YHWH—be strong, || And He strengthens your heart, || Indeed, look to YHWH!
\c 28
\p
\v 1 BY DAVID. To You, O YHWH, I call, || My rock, do not be silent to me! Lest You are silent to me, || And I have been compared || With those going down to the pit.
\v 2 Hear the voice of my supplications, || In my crying to You, || In my lifting up my hands toward your holy oracle.
\v 3 Do not draw me with the wicked, || And with workers of iniquity, || Speaking peace with their neighbors, || And evil in their heart.
\v 4 Give to them according to their acting, || And according to the evil of their doings. Give to them according to the work of their hands. Return their deed to them.
\v 5 For they do not attend to the doing of YHWH, || And to the work of His hands. He throws them down, || And does not build them up.
\v 6 Blessed [is] YHWH, || For He has heard the voice of my supplications.
\v 7 YHWH [is] my strength, and my shield, || In Him my heart trusted, and I have been helped. And my heart exults, || And I thank Him with my song.
\v 8 YHWH [is] strength to him, || Indeed, the strength of the salvation of His anointed [is] He.
\v 9 Save Your people, and bless Your inheritance, || And feed them, and carry them for all time!
\c 29
\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF DAVID. Ascribe to YHWH, you sons of the mighty, || Ascribe to YHWH glory and strength.
\v 2 Ascribe to YHWH the glory of His Name, || Bow yourselves to YHWH, || In the beauty of holiness.
\v 3 The voice of YHWH [is] on the waters, || The God of glory has thundered, || YHWH [is] on many waters.
\v 4 The voice of YHWH [is] with power, || The voice of YHWH [is] with majesty,
\v 5 The voice of YHWH [is] shattering cedars, || Indeed, YHWH shatters the cedars of Lebanon.
\v 6 And He causes them to skip as a calf, || Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems,
\v 7 The voice of YHWH is hewing fiery flames,
\v 8 The voice of YHWH pains a wilderness, || YHWH pains the wilderness of Kadesh.
\v 9 The voice of YHWH pains the oaks, || And makes bare the forests, || And in His temple everyone says, “Glory!”
\v 10 YHWH has sat on the flood, || And YHWH sits [as] king for all time,
\v 11 YHWH gives strength to His people, || YHWH blesses His people with peace!
\c 30
\p
\v 1 A PSALM. A SONG OF THE DEDICATION OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID. I exalt You, O YHWH, || For You have drawn me up, || And have not let my enemies rejoice over me.
\v 2 My God YHWH, I have cried to You, || And You heal me.
\v 3 YHWH, You have brought up my soul from Sheol, || You have kept me alive, || From going down [to] the pit.
\v 4 Sing praise to YHWH, you His saints, || And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness,
\v 5 For—a moment [is] in His anger, || Life [is] in His goodwill, || At evening remains weeping, and at morning singing.
\v 6 And I have said in my ease, “I am not moved for all time.
\v 7 O YHWH, in Your good pleasure, || You have caused strength to remain for my mountain,” || You have hidden Your face—I have been troubled.
\v 8 To You, O YHWH, I call, || And to YHWH I make supplication.
\v 9 “What gain [is] in my blood? In my going down to corruption? Does dust thank You? Does it declare Your truth?
\v 10 Hear, O YHWH, and favor me, O YHWH, be a helper to me.”
\v 11 You have turned my mourning to dancing for me, || You have loosed my sackcloth, || And gird me [with] joy.
\v 12 So that glory praises You, and is not silent, || O YHWH, my God, I thank You for all time!
\c 31
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. In You, O YHWH, I have trusted, || Do not let me be ashamed for all time, || In Your righteousness deliver me.
\v 2 Incline Your ear to me quickly, deliver me, || Be to me for a strong rock, || For a house of bulwarks to save me.
\v 3 For You [are] my rock and my bulwark, || For Your Name’s sake lead me and tend me.
\v 4 Bring me out from the net that they hid for me, || For You [are] my strength.
\v 5 Into Your hand I commit my spirit, || You have redeemed me, YHWH God of truth.
\v 6 I have hated the observers of lying vanities, || And I have been confident toward YHWH.
\v 7 I rejoice, and am glad in Your kindness, || In that You have seen my affliction, || You have known my soul in adversities.
\v 8 And You have not shut me up, || Into the hand of an enemy, || You have caused my feet to stand in a broad place.
\v 9 Favor me, O YHWH, for distress [is] to me, || My eye, my soul, and my body || Have become old by provocation.
\v 10 For my life has been consumed in sorrow || And my years in sighing. My strength has been feeble because of my iniquity, || And my bones have become old.
\v 11 I have been a reproach among all my adversaries, || And to my neighbors exceedingly, || And a fear to my acquaintances, || Those seeing me without—fled from me.
\v 12 I have been forgotten as dead, out of mind, || I have been as a perishing vessel.
\v 13 For I have heard an evil account of many, || Fear [is] all around. In their being united against me, || They have devised to take my life,
\v 14 And I have trusted on You, || O YHWH, I have said, “You [are] my God.”
\v 15 In Your hand [are] my times, || Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, || And from my pursuers.
\v 16 Cause Your face to shine on Your servant, || Save me in Your kindness.
\v 17 O YHWH, do not let me be ashamed, || For I have called You, let the wicked be ashamed, || Let them become silent to Sheol.
\v 18 Let lips of falsehood become mute, || That are speaking against the righteous, || Ancient sayings, in pride and contempt.
\v 19 How abundant is Your goodness, || That You have laid up for those fearing You, || You have worked for those trusting in You, || Before sons of men.
\v 20 You hide them in the secret place of Your presence, || From schemes of man, || You conceal them in a dwelling place, || From the strife of tongues.
\v 21 Blessed [is] YHWH, || For He has made His kindness marvelous || To me in a city of bulwarks.
\v 22 And I have said in my haste, “I have been cut off from before Your eyes,” || But You have heard the voice of my supplications, || In my crying to You.
\v 23 Love YHWH, all you His saints, || YHWH is keeping the faithful, || And repaying a proud doer abundantly.
\v 24 Be strong, and He strengthens your heart, || All you who are waiting for YHWH!
\c 32
\p
\v 1 AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID. O the blessedness of him whose transgression [is] forgiven, || Whose sin is covered.
\v 2 O the blessedness of a man, || To whom YHWH does not impute iniquity, || And in whose spirit there is no deceit.
\v 3 When I have kept silence, my bones have become old, || Through my roaring all the day.
\v 4 When by day and by night Your hand is heavy on me, || My moisture has been changed || Into the droughts of summer. Selah.
\v 5 I cause You to know my sin, || And I have not covered my iniquity. I have said, “I confess to YHWH concerning My transgressions,” || And You have taken away the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
\v 6 For every saintly one prays this to You, || In the time to find [You]. Surely at an overflowing of many waters, || They do not come to him.
\v 7 You [are] a hiding place for me, || You keep me from distress, || Surround me [with] songs of deliverance. Selah.
\v 8 I cause you to act wisely, || And direct you in the way that you go, || I cause My eye to take counsel concerning you.
\v 9 Do not be as a horse—as a mule, || Without understanding, || With bridle and bit, its ornaments, to curb, || Not to come near to you.
\v 10 Many [are] the pains of the wicked; As for him who is trusting in YHWH, || Kindness surrounds him.
\v 11 Be glad in YHWH, and rejoice, you righteous, || And sing, all you upright of heart!
\c 33
\p
\v 1 Sing, you righteous, in YHWH, || [For] praise from upright ones [is] lovely.
\v 2 Give thanks to YHWH with a harp, || With stringed instrument of ten strings sing praise to Him,
\v 3 Sing to Him a new song, || Play skillfully with shouting.
\v 4 For the word of YHWH [is] upright, || And all His work [is] in faithfulness.
\v 5 Loving righteousness and judgment, || The earth is full of the kindness of YHWH.
\v 6 By the word of YHWH || The heavens have been made, || And all their host by the breath of His mouth.
\v 7 Gathering the waters of the sea as a heap, || Putting the depths in treasuries.
\v 8 All the earth is afraid of YHWH, || All the inhabitants of the world are afraid of Him.
\v 9 For He has spoken, and it is, || He has commanded, and it stands.
\v 10 YHWH made void the counsel of nations, || He disallowed the thoughts of the peoples.
\v 11 The counsel of YHWH stands for all time, || The thoughts of His heart from generation to generation.
\v 12 O the blessedness of the nation whose God [is] YHWH, || Of the people He chose, || For an inheritance to Him.
\v 13 YHWH has looked from the heavens, || He has seen all the sons of men.
\v 14 From the fixed place of His dwelling, || He looked to all inhabitants of the earth;
\v 15 Who is forming their hearts together, || Who is attending to all their works.
\v 16 The king is not saved by the multitude of a force. A mighty man is not delivered, || By abundance of power.
\v 17 A false thing [is] the horse for safety, || And he does not deliver || By the abundance of his strength.
\v 18 Behold, the eye of YHWH [is] to those fearing Him, || To those waiting for His kindness,
\v 19 To deliver their soul from death, || And to keep them alive in famine.
\v 20 Our soul has waited for YHWH, || He [is] our help and our shield,
\v 21 For our heart rejoices in Him, || For we have trusted in His Holy Name.
\v 22 Let Your kindness, O YHWH, be on us, || As we have waited for You!
\c 34
\p
\v 1 BY DAVID, IN HIS CHANGING HIS BEHAVIOR BEFORE ABIMELECH, AND HE DRIVES HIM AWAY, AND HE GOES. [ALEPH-BET] I bless YHWH at all times, || His praise [is] continually in my mouth.
\v 2 In YHWH my soul boasts herself, || The humble hear and rejoice.
\v 3 Ascribe greatness to YHWH with me, || And we exalt His Name together.
\v 4 I sought YHWH, and He answered me, || And delivered me from all my fears.
\v 5 They looked expectingly to Him, || And they became bright, || And their faces are not ashamed.
\v 6 This poor [one] called, and YHWH heard, || And saved him from all his distresses.
\v 7 A messenger of YHWH is encamping, || Around those who fear Him, || And He arms them.
\v 8 Taste and see that YHWH [is] good, || O the blessedness of the man who trusts in Him.
\v 9 Fear YHWH, you His holy ones, || For there is no lack to those fearing Him.
\v 10 Young lions have lacked and been hungry, || And those seeking YHWH do not lack any good,
\v 11 Come, children, listen to me, || I teach you the fear of YHWH.
\v 12 Who [is] the man that is desiring life? Loving days to see good?
\v 13 Keep your tongue from evil, || And your lips from speaking deceit.
\v 14 Turn aside from evil and do good, || Seek peace and pursue it.
\v 15 The eyes of YHWH [are] to the righteous, || And His ears to their cry.
\v 16 (The face of YHWH [is] on doers of evil, || To cut off their memorial from earth.)
\v 17 They cried, and YHWH heard, || And delivered them from all their distresses.
\v 18 YHWH [is] near to the broken of heart, || And He saves the bruised of spirit.
\v 19 Many [are] the afflictions of the righteous, || YHWH delivers him out of them all.
\v 20 He is keeping all his bones, || Not one of them has been broken.
\v 21 Evil puts the wicked to death, || And those hating the righteous are desolate.
\v 22 YHWH redeems the soul of His servants, || And none trusting in Him are desolate!
\c 35
\p
\v 1 BY DAVID. Strive, YHWH, with my strivers, fight with my fighters,
\v 2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help,
\v 3 And draw out spear and lance, || To meet my pursuers. Say to my soul, “I [am] your salvation.”
\v 4 They are ashamed and blush, those seeking my soul, || Turned backward and confounded, || Those devising my evil.
\v 5 They are as chaff before wind, || And a messenger of YHWH driving away.
\v 6 Their way is darkness and slipperiness, || And a messenger of YHWH—their pursuer.
\v 7 For without cause they hid their net [in] a pit for me, || Without cause they dug for my soul.
\v 8 Desolation meets him—he does not know, || And his net that he hid catches him, || He falls into it for desolation.
\v 9 And my soul is joyful in YHWH, || It rejoices in His salvation.
\v 10 All my bones say, “YHWH, who is like You, || Delivering the poor from the [one] stronger than he, || And the poor and needy from his plunderer.”
\v 11 Violent witnesses rise up, || That which I have not known they ask me.
\v 12 They pay me evil for good, bereaving my soul,
\v 13 And I—in their sickness my clothing [is] sackcloth, || I have humbled my soul with fastings, || And my prayer returns to my bosom.
\v 14 As [if] a friend, as [if] my brother, || I habitually walked, || As a mourner for a mother, || I have bowed down mourning.
\v 15 And they have rejoiced in my halting, || And have been gathered together, || The strikers were gathered against me, || And I have not known, || They have torn, and they have not ceased;
\v 16 With profane ones, mockers in feasts, || Gnashing their teeth against me.
\v 17 Lord, how long do You behold? Keep my soul back from their desolations, || My only one from young lions.
\v 18 I thank You in a great assembly, || I praise You among a mighty people.
\v 19 Do not let my enemies rejoice over me [with] falsehood, || Those hating me without cause wink the eye.
\v 20 For they do not speak peace, || And against the quiet of the land, || They devise deceitful words,
\v 21 And they enlarge their mouth against me, || They said, “Aha, aha, our eye has seen.”
\v 22 You have seen, O YHWH, || Do not be silent, O Lord—do not be far from me,
\v 23 Stir up, and wake to my judgment, || My God, and my Lord, to my plea.
\v 24 Judge me according to Your righteousness, O YHWH my God, || And they do not rejoice over me.
\v 25 They do not say in their heart, “Aha, our desire.” They do not say, “We swallowed him up.”
\v 26 They are ashamed and confounded together, || Who are rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion, || Who are magnifying themselves against me.
\v 27 They sing and rejoice, who are desiring my righteousness, || And they continually say, “YHWH is magnified, || Who is desiring the peace of His servant.”
\v 28 And my tongue utters Your righteousness, || All the day Your praise!
\c 36
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. BY A SERVANT OF YHWH, BY DAVID. The transgression of the wicked || Is affirming within my heart, “Fear of God is not before his eyes,
\v 2 For he made [it] smooth to himself in his eyes, || To find his iniquity to be hated.
\v 3 The words of his mouth [are] iniquity and deceit, || He ceased to act prudently—to do good.
\v 4 He devises iniquity on his bed, || He stations himself on a way not good, || He does not refuse evil.”
\v 5 O YHWH, Your kindness [is] in the heavens, || Your faithfulness [is] to the clouds.
\v 6 Your righteousness [is] as mountains of God, || Your judgments [are] a great deep. You save man and beast, O YHWH.
\v 7 How precious [is] Your kindness, O God, || And the sons of men trust || In the shadow of Your wings.
\v 8 They are filled from the fatness of Your house, || And You cause them to drink the stream of Your delights.
\v 9 For a fountain of life [is] with You, || In Your light we see light.
\v 10 Draw out Your kindness to those knowing You, || And Your righteousness to the upright of heart.
\v 11 Do not let a foot of pride meet me, || And do not let a hand of the wicked move me.
\v 12 Workers of iniquity have fallen there, || They have been overthrown, || And have not been able to arise!
\c 37
\p
\v 1 BY DAVID. [ALEPH-BET] Do not fret because of evildoers, || Do not be envious against doers of iniquity,
\v 2 For they are cut off speedily as grass, || And fade as the greenness of the tender grass.
\v 3 Trust in YHWH, and do good, || Dwell [in] the land, and enjoy faithfulness,
\v 4 And delight yourself on YHWH, || And He gives to you the petitions of your heart.
\v 5 Roll your way on YHWH, || And trust on Him, and He works,
\v 6 And has brought out your righteousness as light, || And your judgment as noon-day.
\v 7 Be silent for YHWH, and stay yourself for Him, || Do not fret because of him || Who is making his way prosperous, || Because of a man doing wicked schemes.
\v 8 Desist from anger, and forsake fury, || Do not fret yourself to only do evil.
\v 9 For evildoers are cut off, || As for those waiting on YHWH, they possess the land.
\v 10 And yet a little [while], and the wicked is not, || And you have considered his place, and it is not.
\v 11 And the humble possess the land, || And they have delighted themselves || In the abundance of peace.
\v 12 The wicked is devising against the righteous, || And gnashing his teeth against him.
\v 13 The Lord laughs at him, || For He has seen that his day comes.
\v 14 The wicked have opened a sword, || And they have bent their bow, || To cause the poor and needy to fall, || To slaughter the upright of the way.
\v 15 Their sword enters into their own heart, || And their bows are shattered.
\v 16 Better [is] the little of the righteous, || Than the store of many wicked.
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked are shattered, || And YHWH is sustaining the righteous.
\v 18 YHWH knows the days of the perfect, || And their inheritance is for all time.
\v 19 They are not ashamed in a time of evil, || And they are satisfied in days of famine.
\v 20 But the wicked perish, and the enemies of YHWH, || Have been consumed as the preciousness of lambs, || They have been consumed in smoke.
\v 21 The wicked is borrowing and does not repay, || And the righteous is gracious and giving.
\v 22 For His blessed ones possess the land, || And His reviled ones are cut off.
\v 23 The steps of a man [are] from YHWH, || They have been prepared, || And He desires his way.
\v 24 When he falls, he is not cast down, || For YHWH is sustaining his hand.
\v 25 I have been young, || I have also become old, || And I have not seen the righteous forsaken, || And his seed seeking bread.
\v 26 All the day he is gracious and lending, || And his seed [is] for a blessing.
\v 27 Turn aside from evil, and do good, and dwell for all time.
\v 28 For YHWH is loving judgment, || And He does not forsake His saintly ones, || They have been kept for all time, || And the seed of the wicked is cut off.
\v 29 The righteous possess the land, || And they dwell on it forever.
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, || And his tongue speaks judgment.
\v 31 The law of his God [is] his heart, || His steps do not slide.
\v 32 The wicked is watching for the righteous, || And is seeking to put him to death.
\v 33 YHWH does not leave him in his hand, || Nor condemn him in his being judged.
\v 34 Look to YHWH, and keep His way, || And He exalts you to possess the land, || In the wicked being cut off—you see!
\v 35 I have seen the wicked terrible, || And spreading as a green native plant,
\v 36 And he passes away, and behold, he is not, || And I seek him, and he is not found!
\v 37 Observe the perfect, and see the upright, || For the latter end of each [is] peace.
\v 38 And transgressors were destroyed together, || The latter end of the wicked was cut off.
\v 39 And the salvation of the righteous [is] from YHWH, || Their strong place in a time of adversity.
\v 40 And YHWH helps them and delivers them, || He delivers them from the wicked, || And saves them, || Because they trusted in Him!

\v 1 A PSALM OF DAVID. “TO CAUSE TO REMEMBER.” YHWH, do not reprove me in Your wrath, || Nor discipline me in Your fury.
\v 2 For Your arrows have come down on me, || And You let down Your hand on me.
\v 3 Soundness is not in my flesh, || Because of Your indignation, || Peace is not in my bones, || Because of my sin.
\v 4 For my iniquities have passed over my head, || As a heavy burden—too heavy for me.
\v 5 Stunk—my wounds have become corrupt, || Because of my folly.
\v 6 I have been bent down, || I have been bowed down—to excess, || I have gone mourning all the day.
\v 7 For my flanks have been full of drought, || And soundness is not in my flesh.
\v 8 I have been feeble and struck—to excess, || I have roared from disquietude of heart.
\v 9 Lord, all my desire [is] before You, || And my sighing has not been hid from You.
\v 10 My heart [is] panting, my power has forsaken me, || And the light of my eyes, || Even they are not with me.
\v 11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from before my plague. And my neighbors have stood far off.
\v 12 And those seeking my soul lay a snare, || And those seeking my evil || Have spoken mischievous things, || And they meditate [on] deceits all the day.
\v 13 And I, as deaf, do not hear. And as a mute one who does not open his mouth.
\v 14 Indeed, I am as a man who does not hear, || And in his mouth are no reproofs.
\v 15 Because for You, O YHWH, I have waited, || You answer, O Lord my God.
\v 16 When I said, “Lest they rejoice over me, || In the slipping of my foot they magnified themselves against me.”
\v 17 For I am ready to halt, || And my pain [is] continually before me.
\v 18 For I declare my iniquity, || I am sorry for my sin.
\v 19 And my enemies [are] lively, || They have been strong, and those hating me without cause, || Have been multiplied.
\v 20 And those paying evil for good accuse me, || Because of my pursuing good.
\v 21 Do not forsake me, O YHWH, || My God, do not be far from me,
\v 22 Hurry to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
\c 39

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. FOR JEDUTHUN. A PSALM OF DAVID. I have said, “I observe my ways, || Against sinning with my tongue, || I keep a curb for my mouth, || While the wicked [is] before me.”
\v 2 I was mute [with] silence, || I kept silent from good, and my pain is excited.
\v 3 My heart [is] hot within me, || In my meditating the fire burns, || I have spoken with my tongue.
\v 4 “Cause me to know, O YHWH, my end, || And the measure of my days—what it [is],” || I know how frail I [am].
\v 5 Behold, You have made my days handbreadths, || And my age [is] as nothing before You, || Only, every man set up [is] all vanity. Selah.
\v 6 Only, each habitually walks in an image, || Only, [in] vain, they are disquieted, || He heaps up and does not know who gathers them.
\v 7 And now, what have I expected? O Lord, my hope—it [is] of You.
\v 8 Deliver me from all my transgressions, || Do not make me a reproach of the fool.
\v 9 I have been mute, I do not open my mouth, || Because You have done [it].
\v 10 Turn aside Your stroke from off me, || From the striving of Your hand I have been consumed.
\v 11 With reproofs against iniquity, || You have corrected man, || And dissolve his desirableness as a moth, || Only, every man [is] vanity. Selah.
\v 12 Hear my prayer, O YHWH, || And give ear [to] my cry, || Do not be silent to my tear, || For I [am] a sojourner with You, || A settler like all my fathers.
\v 13 Look from me, and I brighten up before I go and am not!
\c 40
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. I have diligently expected YHWH, || And He inclines to me, and hears my cry,
\v 2 And He causes me to come up || From a pit of desolation—from mire of mud, || And He raises up my feet on a rock, || He is establishing my steps.
\v 3 And He puts a new song in my mouth, “Praise to our God.” Many see and fear, and trust in YHWH.
\v 4 O the blessedness of the man || Who has made YHWH his trust, || And has not turned to the proud, || And those turning aside to lies.
\v 5 You have done much, my God YHWH; Your wonders and Your thoughts toward us, || There is none to arrange to You, || I declare and speak: They have been more than to be numbered.
\v 6 Sacrifice and present You have not desired, || But a body You have prepared for me, || Burnt and sin-offering You have not asked.
\v 7 Then I said, “Behold, I have come, || In the roll of the scroll it is written of me,
\v 8 I have delighted to do Your pleasure, my God, || And Your law [is] within my heart.”
\v 9 I have proclaimed tidings of righteousness || In the great assembly, || Behold, I do not restrain my lips, || O YHWH, You have known.
\v 10 I have not concealed Your righteousness || In the midst of my heart, || I have told of Your faithfulness and Your salvation, || I have not hidden Your kindness and Your truth, || To the great assembly.
\v 11 You, O YHWH, do not restrain Your mercies from me, || Your kindness and Your truth continually keep me.
\v 12 For innumerable evils have surrounded me, || My iniquities have overtaken me, || And I have not been able to see; They have been more than the hairs of my head, || And my heart has forsaken me.
\v 13 Be pleased, O YHWH, to deliver me, || O YHWH, make haste for my help.
\v 14 They are ashamed and confounded together, || Who are seeking my soul to destroy it, || They are turned backward, || And are ashamed, who are desiring my evil.
\v 15 They are desolate because of their shame, || Who are saying to me, “Aha, aha.”
\v 16 All seeking You rejoice and are glad in You, || Those loving Your salvation continually say, “YHWH is magnified.”
\v 17 And I [am] poor and needy, || The Lord devises for me. You [are] my help and my deliverer, O my God, do not linger.
\c 41
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. O the blessedness of him || Who is acting wisely to the poor, || In a day of evil YHWH delivers him.
\v 2 YHWH preserves him and revives him, || He is blessed in the land, || And You do not give him into the will of his enemies.
\v 3 YHWH supports [him] on a bed of sickness, || You have turned his bed in his weakness.
\v 4 I said, “O YHWH, favor me, || Heal my soul, for I sinned against You,”
\v 5 My enemies say evil of me: When he dies—his name has perished!
\v 6 And if he came to see—he speaks vanity, || His heart gathers iniquity to itself, || He goes out—at the street he speaks.
\v 7 All hating me whisper together against me, || Against me they devise evil to me:
\v 8 A worthless thing is poured out on him, || And because he lay down he does not rise again.
\v 9 Even my ally, in whom I trusted, || One eating my bread, || Made the heel great against me,
\v 10 And You, YHWH, favor me, || And cause me to rise, || And I give repayment to them.
\v 11 By this I have known, || That You have delighted in me, || Because my enemy does not shout over me.
\v 12 As for me, in my integrity, || You have taken hold on me, || And cause me to stand before You for all time.
\v 13 Blessed [is] YHWH, God of Israel, || From age to age. Amen and Amen.

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. AN INSTRUCTION OF THE SONS OF KORAH. As a deer pants for streams of water, || So my soul pants toward You, O God.
\v 2 My soul thirsted for God, for the living God, || When do I enter and see the face of God?
\v 3 My tear has been bread day and night to me, || In their saying to me all the day, “Where [is] your God?”
\v 4 These I remember, and pour out my soul in me, || For I pass over into the shelter, || I go softly with them to the house of God, || With the voice of singing and confession, || The multitude keeping celebration!
\v 5 Why bow yourself, O my soul? Indeed, are you troubled within me? Wait for God, for I still confess Him: The salvation of my countenance—my God!
\v 6 My soul bows itself in me, || Therefore I remember You from the land of Jordan, || And of the Hermons, from Mount Mizar.
\v 7 Deep is calling to deep || At the noise of Your waterspouts, || All Your breakers and Your billows passed over me.
\v 8 By day YHWH commands His kindness, || And by night a song [is] with me, || A prayer to the God of my life.
\v 9 I say to God my Rock, “Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning in the oppression of an enemy?”
\v 10 With a sword in my bones || My adversaries have reproached me, || In their saying to me all the day, “Where [is] your God?”
\v 11 Why bow yourself, O my soul? And why are you troubled within me? Wait for God, for I still confess Him, || The salvation of my countenance, and my God!
\c 43
\p
\v 1 Judge me, O God, || And plead my cause against a nation not pious, || You deliver me from a man of deceit and perverseness,
\v 2 For you [are] the God of my strength. Why have You cast me off? Why do I go up and down mourning, || In the oppression of an enemy?
\v 3 Send forth Your light and Your truth, || They lead me, they bring me in, || To Your holy hill, and to Your dwelling places.
\v 4 And I go to the altar of God, || To God, the joy of my rejoicing. And I thank You with a harp, O God, my God.
\v 5 Why bow yourself, O my soul? And why are you troubled within me? Wait for God, for I still confess Him, || The salvation of my countenance, and my God!

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. AN INSTRUCTION OF THE SONS OF KORAH. O God, we have heard with our ears, || Our fathers have recounted to us, || The work You worked in their days, || In the days of old.
\v 2 You, [with] Your hand, have dispossessed nations. And You plant them. You afflict peoples, and send them away.
\v 3 For they did not possess the land by their sword, || And their arm did not give salvation to them, || But Your right hand, and Your arm, || And the light of Your countenance, || Because You had accepted them.
\v 4 You [are] He, my King, O God, || Command the deliverances of Jacob.
\v 5 By You we push our adversaries, || By Your Name we tread down our withstanders,
\v 6 For I do not trust in my bow, || And my sword does not save me.
\v 7 For You have saved us from our adversaries, || And You have put to shame those hating us.
\v 8 In God we have boasted all the day, || And we thank Your Name for all time. Selah.
\v 9 In anger You have cast off and cause us to blush, || And do not go forth with our hosts.
\v 10 You cause us to turn backward from an adversary, || And those hating us, || Have spoiled for themselves.
\v 11 You make us food like sheep, || And You have scattered us among nations.
\v 12 You sell Your people—without wealth, || And have not become great by their price.
\v 13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors, || A scorn and a reproach to our surrounders.
\v 14 You make us an allegory among nations, || A shaking of the head among peoples.
\v 15 All the day my confusion [is] before me, || And the shame of my face has covered me.
\v 16 Because of the voice of a reproacher and reviler, || Because of an enemy and a self-avenger.
\v 17 All this met us, and we did not forget You, || Nor have we dealt falsely in Your covenant.
\v 18 We do not turn our heart backward, || Nor turn aside our step from Your path.
\v 19 But You have struck us in a place of dragons, || And cover us over with death-shade.
\v 20 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, || And spread our hands to a strange God,
\v 21 Does God not search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart.
\v 22 Surely, for Your sake we have been slain all the day, || Reckoned as sheep of the slaughter.
\v 23 Stir up—why do You sleep, O Lord? Awake, do not cast us off forever.
\v 24 Why do You hide Your face? You forget our afflictions and our oppression,
\v 25 For our soul has bowed to the dust, || Our belly has cleaved to the earth.
\v 26 Arise, a help to us, || And ransom us for your kindness’ sake.

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. [SET] ON “LILIES.” AN INSTRUCTION OF THE SONS OF KORAH. A SONG OF LOVES. My heart has stirred a good word, || I am telling my works to the King, || My tongue [is] the pen of a speedy writer.
\v 2 You have been beautified above the sons of men, || Grace has been poured into Your lips, || Therefore God has blessed You for all time.
\v 3 Gird Your sword on the thigh, O Mighty [One], || Your splendor and Your majesty!
\v 4 As for Your majesty—prosper [and] ride! Because of truth, meekness, [and] righteousness, || And Your right hand shows You fearful things.
\v 5 Your arrows [are] sharp—Peoples fall under You—In the heart of the enemies of the King.
\v 6 Your throne, O God, [is for] all time and forever, || A scepter of uprightness || [Is] the scepter of Your kingdom.
\v 7 You have loved righteousness and hate wickedness, || Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You || With oil of joy above Your companions.
\v 8 Myrrh, and aloes, [and] cassia || [Cover] all Your garments; Out of palaces of ivory, || Stringed instruments have made You glad.
\v 9 Daughters of kings [are] among Your precious ones, || A queen has stood at Your right hand, || In pure gold of Ophir.
\v 10 Listen, O daughter, and see, incline your ear, || And forget your people, and your father’s house,
\v 11 And the King desires your beauty, || Because He [is] your Lord—bow yourself to Him,
\v 12 And the daughter of Tyre with a present, || The rich of the people appease your face.
\v 13 All glory [is] the daughter of the king within, || Her clothing [is] with filigrees of gold.
\v 14 In various colors she is brought to the King; Afterward, virgins, her companions, || Are brought to You.
\v 15 They are brought with joy and gladness, || They come into the palace of the King.
\v 16 Instead of Your fathers are Your sons, || You appoint them for princes in all the earth.
\v 17 I make mention of Your Name in all generations, || Therefore peoples praise You, || For all time and forever!

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. BY SONS OF KORAH. FOR GIRLS’ [VOICES]. A SONG. God [is] our refuge and strength, || A most sure help in adversities.
\v 2 Therefore we do not fear in the changing of earth, || And in the slipping of mountains || Into the heart of the seas.
\v 3 Roar—troubled are its waters, || Mountains shake in its pride. Selah.
\v 4 A river—its streams make glad the city of God, || Your holy place of the dwelling places of the Most High.
\v 5 God [is] in her midst—she is not moved, God helps her at the turn of the morning!
\v 6 Nations have been troubled, || Kingdoms have been moved, || He has given forth with His voice—earth melts.
\v 7 YHWH of Hosts [is] with us, || The God of Jacob [is] a tower for us. Selah.
\v 8 Come, see the works of YHWH, || Who has done astonishing things in the earth,
\v 9 Causing wars to cease, || To the end of the earth, He shatters the bow, || And He has cut apart the spear, || He burns chariots with fire.
\v 10 Desist, and know that I [am] God, || I am exalted among nations, || I am exalted in the earth.
\v 11 YHWH of hosts [is] with us, || The God of Jacob [is] a tower for us! Selah.

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. All you peoples, clap the hand, || Shout to God with a voice of singing,
\v 2 For YHWH Most High [is] fearful, || A great King over all the earth.
\v 3 He leads peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
\v 4 He chooses for us our inheritance, || The excellence of Jacob that He loves. Selah.
\v 5 God has gone up with a shout, || YHWH with the sound of a horn.
\v 6 Praise God—praise—give praise to our king, praise.
\v 7 For God [is] King of all the earth, || Give praise, O understanding one.
\v 8 God has reigned over nations, God has sat on His holy throne,
\v 9 Nobles of peoples have been gathered, || [With] the people of the God of Abraham, || For the shields of earth [are] to God, || Greatly has He been exalted!
\c 48
\p
\v 1 A SONG. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. Great [is] YHWH, and greatly praised, || In the city of our God—His holy hill.
\v 2 Beautiful [for] elevation, || A joy of all the land, [is] Mount Zion, || The sides of the north, the city of [the] great King.
\v 3 God is known for a tower in her high places.
\v 4 For behold, the kings met, they passed by together,
\v 5 They have seen—so they have marveled, || They have been troubled, they were hurried away.
\v 6 Trembling has seized them there, || Pain, as of a travailing woman.
\v 7 By an east wind You shatter ships of Tarshish.
\v 8 As we have heard, so we have seen, || In the city of YHWH of hosts, || In the city of our God, God establishes her for all time. Selah.
\v 9 We have thought, O God, of Your kindness, || In the midst of Your temple,
\v 10 As [is] Your Name, O God, so [is] Your praise, || Over the ends of the earth, || Righteousness has filled Your right hand.
\v 11 Mount Zion rejoices, || The daughters of Judah are joyful, || For the sake of Your judgments.
\v 12 Surround Zion, and go around her, count her towers,
\v 13 Set your heart to her bulwark, || Consider her high places, || So that you recount to a later generation,
\v 14 That this God [is] our God—For all time and forever, || He leads us over death!
\c 49
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. Hear this, all you peoples, || Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world.
\v 2 Both low and high, together rich and needy.
\v 3 My mouth speaks wise things, || And the meditations of my heart [are] things of understanding.
\v 4 I incline my ear to an allegory, || I open my riddle with a harp:
\v 5 Why do I fear in days of evil? The iniquity of my supplanters surrounds me.
\v 6 Those trusting on their wealth, || And in the multitude of their riches, || Show themselves foolish.
\v 7 A brother ransoms no one at all, || He does not give to God his atonement.
\v 8 And precious [is] the redemption of their soul, || And it has ceased for all time.
\v 9 And still he lives forever, || He does not see the pit.
\v 10 For he sees wise men die, || Together the foolish and brutish perish, || And have left their wealth to others.
\v 11 Their heart [is that] their houses [are] for all time, || Their dwelling places from generation to generation. They proclaimed their names over the lands.
\v 12 And man does not remain in honor, || He has been like the beasts, they have been cut off.
\v 13 This their way [is] folly for them, || And their posterity are pleased with their sayings. Selah.
\v 14 They have set themselves as sheep for Sheol, || Death afflicts them, || And the upright rule over them in the morning, || And their form [is] for consumption. Sheol [is] a dwelling for him.
\v 15 Only, God ransoms my soul from the hand of Sheol, || For He receives me. Selah.
\v 16 Do not fear when one makes wealth, || When the glory of his house is abundant,
\v 17 For at his death he receives nothing, || His glory does not go down after him.
\v 18 For he blesses his soul in his life || (And they praise you when you do well for yourself).
\v 19 It comes to the generation of his fathers, || They do not see the light forever.
\v 20 Man in honor, who does not understand, || Has been like the beasts, they have been cut off!
\c 50
\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF ASAPH. The God of gods—YHWH—has spoken, || And He calls to the earth || From the rising of the sun to its going in.
\v 2 From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shone.
\v 3 Our God comes, and is not silent, || Fire devours before Him, || And around Him it has been very tempestuous.
\v 4 He calls to the heavens from above, || And to the earth, to judge His people.
\v 5 Gather My saints to Me, || Making covenant with Me over a sacrifice.
\v 6 And the heavens declare His righteousness, || For God Himself is judging. Selah.
\v 7 Hear, O My people, and I speak, || O Israel, and I testify against you, || God—I [am] your God.
\v 8 I do not reprove you for your sacrifices, || Indeed, your burnt-offerings || [Are] continually before Me.
\v 9 I do not take a bullock from your house, || [Or] male goats from your folds.
\v 10 For every beast of the forest [is] Mine, || The livestock on the hills of oxen.
\v 11 I have known every bird of the mountains, || And the wild beast of the field [is] with Me.
\v 12 If I am hungry I do not tell [it] to you, || For the world and its fullness [is] Mine.
\v 13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls, || And drink the blood of male goats?
\v 14 Sacrifice to God confession, || And complete your vows to the Most High.
\v 15 And call Me in a day of adversity, || I deliver you, and you honor Me.
\v 16 And to the wicked God has said: What to you—to recount My statutes? That you lift up My covenant on your mouth?
\v 17 Indeed, you have hated instruction, || And cast My words behind you.
\v 18 If you have seen a thief, || Then you are pleased with him, || And your portion [is] with adulterers.
\v 19 You have sent forth your mouth with evil, || And your tongue joins deceit together,
\v 20 You sit, you speak against your brother, || You give slander against a son of your mother.
\v 21 These you did, and I kept silent, || You have thought that I am like you, || I reprove you, and set in array before your eyes.
\v 22 Now understand this, || You who are forgetting God, || Lest I tear, and there is no deliverer.
\v 23 He who is sacrificing praise honors Me, || As for him who makes a way, || I cause him to look on the salvation of God!

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID, IN THE COMING OF NATHAN THE PROPHET TO HIM WHEN HE HAS GONE IN TO BATHSHEBA. Favor me, O God, according to Your kindness, || According to the abundance of Your mercies, || Blot out my transgressions.
\v 2 Thoroughly wash me from my iniquity, || And cleanse me from my sin,
\v 3 For I know my transgressions, || And my sin [is] continually before me.
\v 4 Against You, You only, I have sinned, || And done evil in Your eyes, || So that You are righteous in Your words, || You are pure in Your judging.
\v 5 Behold, I have been brought forth in iniquity, || And my mother conceives me in sin.
\v 6 Behold, You have desired truth in the inward parts, || And in the hidden part You cause me to know Wisdom.
\v 7 You cleanse me with hyssop and I am clean, || Wash me, and I am whiter than snow.
\v 8 You cause me to hear joy and gladness, || You make bones You have bruised joyful.
\v 9 Hide Your face from my sin. And blot out all my iniquities.
\v 10 Create for me a clean heart, O God, || And renew a right spirit within me.
\v 11 Do not cast me forth from Your presence, || And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.
\v 12 Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, || And a willing spirit sustains me.
\v 13 I teach transgressors Your ways, || And sinners return to You.
\v 14 Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, || My tongue sings of Your righteousness.
\v 15 O Lord, you open my lips, || And my mouth declares Your praise.
\v 16 For You do not desire sacrifice, or I give [it], || You do not accept burnt-offering.
\v 17 The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit, || A heart broken and bruised, O God, || You do not despise.
\v 18 Do good in Your good pleasure with Zion, || You build the walls of Jerusalem.
\v 19 Then You desire sacrifices of righteousness, || Burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering, || Then they offer bullocks on your altar!

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID, IN THE COMING IN OF DOEG THE EDOMITE, AND HE DECLARES TO SAUL AND SAYS TO HIM, “DAVID CAME TO THE HOUSE OF AHIMELECH.” Why do you boast in evil, O mighty one? The kindness of God [is] all the day.
\v 2 Your tongue devises mischiefs, || Like a sharp razor, working deceit.
\v 3 You have loved evil rather than good, || Lying, than speaking righteousness. Selah.
\v 4 You have loved all devouring words, || O you deceitful tongue.
\v 5 Also—God breaks you down forever, || Takes you, and pulls you out of the tent, || And He has uprooted you || Out of the land of the living. Selah.
\v 6 And the righteous see, || And fear, and laugh at him.
\v 7 “Behold, the man who does not make God his strong place, || And trusts in the abundance of his riches, || He is strong in his mischiefs.”
\v 8 And I, as a green olive in the house of God, || I have trusted in the kindness of God, || For all time and forever,
\v 9 I thank You for all time, because You have done [it], || And I wait [on] Your Name for [it is] good before Your saints!
\c 53
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. “ON A DISEASE.” AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID. A fool said in his heart, “There is no God.” They have done corruptly, || Indeed, they have done abominable iniquity, || There is none doing good.
\v 2 God looked on the sons of men from the heavens, || To see if there is an understanding one, || [One] seeking God.
\v 3 Everyone went back, together they became filthy, || There is none doing good—not even one.
\v 4 Workers of iniquity have not known, || Those eating my people have eaten bread, || They have not called God.
\v 5 There they feared a fear—there was no fear, || For God has scattered the bones of him || Who is encamping against you, || You have put to shame, || For God has despised them.
\v 6 Who gives the salvation of Israel from Zion? When God turns back [to] a captivity of His people, || Jacob rejoices—Israel is glad!
\c 54
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID, IN THE COMING IN OF THE ZIPHIM, AND THEY SAY TO SAUL, “IS DAVID NOT HIDING HIMSELF WITH US?” O God, save me by Your Name, and judge me by Your might.
\v 2 O God, hear my prayer, || Give ear to the sayings of my mouth,
\v 3 For strangers have risen up against me || And terrible ones have sought my soul, || They have not set God before them. Selah.
\v 4 Behold, God [is] a helper to me, || The Lord [is] with those supporting my soul,
\v 5 Turn back the evil to my enemies, || Cut them off in Your truth.
\v 6 I sacrifice to You with a free-will offering, || I thank Your Name, O YHWH, for [it is] good,
\v 7 For He delivered me from all adversity, || And my eye has looked on my enemies!
\c 55
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID. Give ear, O God, [to] my prayer, || And do not hide from my supplication.
\v 2 Attend to me, and answer me, || I mourn in my meditation, and make a noise,
\v 3 Because of the voice of an enemy, || Because of the oppression of the wicked, || For they cause sorrow to move against me, || And in anger they hate me.
\v 4 My heart is pained within me, || And terrors of death have fallen on me.
\v 5 Fear and trembling come to me, || And horror covers me.
\v 6 And I say, “Who gives to me a pinion as a dove?” I fly away and rest,
\v 7 Behold, I move far off, || I lodge in a wilderness. Selah.
\v 8 I hurry escape for myself, || From a rushing wind, from a whirlwind.
\v 9 Swallow up, O Lord, divide their tongue, || For I saw violence and strife in a city.
\v 10 By day and by night they go around it, on its walls. Both iniquity and perverseness [are] in its midst,
\v 11 Mischiefs [are] in its midst. Fraud and deceit do not depart from its street.
\v 12 For an enemy does not reproach me, or I bear [it], || He who is hating me || Has not magnified himself against me, || Or I hide from him.
\v 13 But you, a man—as my equal, || My familiar friend, and my acquaintance.
\v 14 When together we sweeten counsel, || We walk into the house of God in company.
\v 15 Desolations [are] on them, || They go down [to] Sheol—alive, || For wickedness [is] in their dwelling, in their midst.
\v 16 I call to God, and YHWH saves me.
\v 17 Evening, and morning, and noon, || I meditate, and make a noise, and He hears my voice,
\v 18 He has ransomed my soul in peace || From him who is near to me, || For with the multitude they were with me.
\v 19 God hears and afflicts them, || And He sits of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, and do not fear God,
\v 20 He has sent forth his hands against his well-wishers, || He has defiled his covenant.
\v 21 His mouth has been sweeter than honey, || And his heart [is] war! His words have been softer than oil, || And they [are] drawn [swords].
\v 22 Cast on YHWH that which He has given you, || And He sustains you, || He does not permit the moving of the righteous forever.
\v 23 And You, O God, bring them down || To a pit of destruction, || Men of blood and deceit do not reach to half their days, || And I trust in You!
\c 56
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. [SET] ON “A SILENT DOVE FAR OFF.” A MIKTAM OF DAVID, IN THE PHILISTINES’ TAKING HOLD OF HIM IN GATH. Favor me, O God, for man swallowed me up, || All the day fighting he oppresses me,
\v 2 My enemies have swallowed up all the day, || For many [are] fighting against me, O Most High,
\v 3 [In] the day I am afraid I am confident toward You.
\v 4 In God I praise His word, in God I have trusted, || I do not fear what flesh does to me.
\v 5 All the day they wrest my words, || All their thoughts [are] for evil concerning me,
\v 6 They assemble, they hide, they watch my heels, || When they have expected my soul.
\v 7 They escape by iniquity, || In anger put down the peoples, O God.
\v 8 You have counted my wandering, || You place my tear in Your bottle, || Are they not in Your scroll?
\v 9 Then turn back my enemies in the day I call. This I have known, that God [is] for me.
\v 10 In God I praise the word, || In YHWH I praise the word.
\v 11 In God I trusted, || I do not fear what man does to me,
\v 12 On me, O God, [are] Your vows, || I repay thank-offerings to You.
\v 13 For You have delivered my soul from death, || Do You not [keep] my feet from falling? To habitually walk before God in the light of the living!
\c 57
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. “DO NOT DESTROY.” A MIKTAM OF DAVID, IN HIS FLEEING FROM THE FACE OF SAUL INTO A CAVE. Favor me, O God, favor me, || For my soul is trusting in You, || And I trust in the shadow of Your wings, || Until the calamities pass over.
\v 2 I call to God Most High, || To God [who] is perfecting for me.
\v 3 He sends from the heavens, and saves me, || He reproached [the one] who is panting after me. Selah. God sends forth His kindness and His truth.
\v 4 My soul [is] in the midst of lions, || I lie down [among] flames—sons of men, || Their teeth [are] a spear and arrows, || And their tongue a sharp sword.
\v 5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God, || Your glory above all the earth.
\v 6 They have prepared a net for my steps, || My soul has bowed down, || They have dug a pit before me, || They have fallen into its midst. Selah.
\v 7 My heart is prepared, O God, || My heart is prepared, || I sing and praise.
\v 8 Awake, my glory, awake, stringed instrument and harp, || I awake the morning dawn.
\v 9 I thank You among the peoples, O Lord, || I praise You among the nations.
\v 10 For Your kindness [is] great to the heavens, || And Your truth to the clouds.
\v 11 Be exalted above the heavens, O God. Your glory above all the earth!
\c 58
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. “DO NOT DESTROY.” A MIKTAM OF DAVID. Is it true, O silent one, that you speak righteously? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men?
\v 2 Even in heart you work iniquities, || In the land you ponder the violence of your hands.
\v 3 The wicked have been estranged from the womb, || They have erred from the belly, speaking lies.
\v 4 Their poison [is] as poison of a serpent, || As a deaf cobra shutting its ear,
\v 5 Which does not listen to the voice of whisperers, || A charmer of most skillful charms.
\v 6 O God, break their teeth in their mouth, || Break down the jaw-teeth of young lions, O YHWH.
\v 7 They are melted as waters, || They go up and down for themselves, || His arrow proceeds as they cut themselves off.
\v 8 He goes on as a snail that melts, || [As] an untimely birth of a woman, || They have not seen the sun.
\v 9 Before your pots discern the bramble, || As living, He whirls away in His burning anger.
\v 10 The righteous rejoices that he has seen vengeance, || He washes his steps in the blood of the wicked.
\v 11 And man says: “Surely fruit [is] for the righteous: Surely there is a God judging in the earth!”
\c 59
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. “DO NOT DESTROY.” A MIKTAM OF DAVID, IN SAUL’S SENDING, AND THEY WATCH THE HOUSE TO PUT HIM TO DEATH. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God, || Set me on high from my withstanders.
\v 2 Deliver me from workers of iniquity, || And save me from men of blood.
\v 3 For behold, they laid wait for my soul, || Strong ones are assembled against me, || Not my transgression nor my sin, O YHWH.
\v 4 Without punishment they run and prepare themselves, || Stir up to meet me, and see.
\v 5 And You, YHWH, God of Hosts, God of Israel, || Awake to inspect all the nations. Do not favor any treacherous dealers of iniquity. Selah.
\v 6 They return at evening, || They make a noise like a dog, || And go around the city.
\v 7 Behold, they belch out with their mouths, || Swords [are] in their lips, for “Who hears?”
\v 8 And You, O YHWH, laugh at them, || You mock at all the nations.
\v 9 O my Strength, to You I take heed, || For God [is] my tower—the God of my kindness.
\v 10 God goes before me, || He causes me to look on my enemies.
\v 11 Do not slay them, lest my people forget, || Shake them by Your strength, || And bring them down, O Lord our shield.
\v 12 The sin of their mouth [is] a word of their lips, || And they are captured in their pride, || And they recount from the curse and lying.
\v 13 Consume in fury, consume and they are not, || And they know that God is ruling in Jacob, || To the ends of the earth. Selah.
\v 14 And they return at evening, || They make a noise like a dog, || And they go around the city.
\v 15 They wander for food, || If they are not satisfied—then they murmur.
\v 16 And I sing of Your strength, || And at morning I sing of Your kindness, || For You have been a tower to me, || And a refuge for me in a day of adversity.
\v 17 O my Strength, I sing praise to You, || For God [is] my tower, the God of my kindness!
\c 60
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. [SET] ON “LILY OF TESTIMONY.” A MIKTAM OF DAVID, TO TEACH, IN HIS STRIVING WITH ARAM-NAHARAIM AND WITH ARAM-ZOBAH, WHEN JOAB TURNS BACK AND STRIKES EDOM IN THE VALLEY OF SALT—TWELVE THOUSAND. O God, You had cast us off, || You had broken us—had been angry! You turn back to us.
\v 2 You have caused the land to tremble, || You have broken it, || Heal its breaches, for it has moved.
\v 3 You have shown Your people a hard thing, || You have caused us to drink wine of trembling.
\v 4 You have given an ensign to those fearing You, || To be lifted up as an ensign || Because of truth. Selah.
\v 5 That Your beloved ones may be drawn out, || Save [with] Your right hand, and answer us.
\v 6 God has spoken in His holiness: I exult—I apportion Shechem, || And I measure the Valley of Succoth,
\v 7 Gilead [is] Mine, and Manasseh [is] Mine, || And Ephraim [is] the strength of My head, || Judah [is] My lawgiver,
\v 8 Moab [is] My pot for washing, || Over Edom I cast My shoe, || Shout, concerning Me, O Philistia.
\v 9 Who brings me [to] a city of bulwarks? Who has led me to Edom?
\v 10 Is it not You, O God? Have You cast us off? And do You not go forth, O God, with our hosts?
\v 11 Give to us help from adversity, || And the deliverance of man [is] vain.
\v 12 We do mightily in God, || And He treads down our adversaries!
\c 61
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. ON STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. BY DAVID. Hear, O God, my loud cry, attend to my prayer.
\v 2 I call to You from the end of the land, || In the feebleness of my heart, || You lead me into a rock higher than I.
\v 3 For You have been a refuge for me, || A tower of strength because of the enemy.
\v 4 I sojourn in Your tent for all ages, || I trust in the secret place of Your wings. Selah.
\v 5 For You, O God, have listened to my vows, || You have appointed the inheritance || Of those fearing Your Name.
\v 6 You add days to the days of the king, || His years as generation and generation.
\v 7 He dwells before God for all time, || Appoint kindness and truth—they keep him.
\v 8 So I praise Your Name forever, || When I pay my vows day by day!
\c 62
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. FOR JEDUTHUN. A PSALM OF DAVID. Toward God alone [is] my soul silent, || My salvation [is] from Him.
\v 2 He alone [is] my rock, and my salvation, || My tower, I am not much moved.
\v 3 Until when do you devise mischief against a man? All of you are destroyed, || As a wall inclined, a hedge that is cast down.
\v 4 Only—from his excellence || They have consulted to drive away, || They enjoy a lie, they bless with their mouth, || And revile with their heart. Selah.
\v 5 For God alone, be silent, O my soul, || For my hope [is] from Him.
\v 6 He alone [is] my rock and my salvation, || My tower, I am not moved.
\v 7 On God [is] my salvation, and my glory, || The rock of my strength, my refuge [is] in God.
\v 8 Trust in Him at all times, O people, || Pour forth your heart before Him, || God [is] a refuge for us. Selah.
\v 9 Surely vanity the low, a lie the high. In balances to go up || They [are] lighter than a breath.
\v 10 Do not trust in oppression, || And do not become vain in robbery, || Do not set the heart [on] wealth when it increases.
\v 11 Once has God spoken, twice I heard this, || That “strength [is] with God.”
\v 12 And with You, O Lord, [is] kindness, || For You repay to each, || According to his work!
\c 63
\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF DAVID, IN HIS BEING IN THE WILDERNESS OF JUDAH. O God, You [are] my God, earnestly I seek You, || My soul has thirsted for You, || My flesh has longed for You, || In a dry and weary land, without waters.
\v 2 So I have seen You in the sanctuary, || To behold Your strength and Your glory.
\v 3 Because better [is] Your kindness than life, || My lips praise You.
\v 4 So I bless You in my life, || I lift up my hands in Your Name.
\v 5 As [with] milk and fatness is my soul satisfied, || And [with] singing lips my mouth praises.
\v 6 If I have remembered You on my bed, || I meditate on You in the watches.
\v 7 For You have been a help to me, || And I sing in the shadow of Your wings.
\v 8 My soul has cleaved after You, || Your right hand has taken hold on me.
\v 9 And they who seek my soul for desolation, || Go into the lower parts of the earth.
\v 10 They cause him to run on the edge of the sword, || They are a portion for foxes.
\v 11 And the king rejoices in God, || Everyone swearing by Him boasts, || But the mouth of those speaking lies is stopped!
\c 64
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. Hear, O God, my voice, in my meditation, || You keep my life from the fear of an enemy,
\v 2 Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, || From the tumult of workers of iniquity.
\v 3 Who sharpened their tongue as a sword, || They directed their arrow—a bitter word.
\v 4 To shoot the perfect in secret places, || Suddenly they shoot him, and do not fear.
\v 5 They strengthen an evil thing for themselves, || They recount of the hiding of snares, || They have said, “Who looks at it?”
\v 6 They search out perverse things, “We perfected a searching search,” || And the inward part of man, and the heart, [are] deep.
\v 7 And God shoots them [with] an arrow, || Their wounds have been sudden,
\v 8 And they cause him to stumble, || Their own tongue [is] against them, || Every looker on them flees away.
\v 9 And all men fear, and declare the work of God, || And they have wisely considered His deed.
\v 10 The righteous rejoice in YHWH, || And have trusted in Him, || And all the upright of heart boast!
\c 65
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. A SONG. To You, silence [and] praise, O God, in Zion, || And to You a vow is completed.
\v 2 Hearer of prayer, all flesh comes to You.
\v 3 Matters of iniquities were mightier than I, || Our transgressions—You cover them.
\v 4 O the blessedness of [him whom] You choose, || And draw near, he inhabits Your courts, || We are satisfied with the goodness of Your house, || Your holy temple.
\v 5 By fearful things in righteousness You answer us, || O God of our salvation, || The confidence of all far off || The ends of the earth and sea.
\v 6 Establishing mountains by His power, || He has been girded with might,
\v 7 Restraining the noise of seas, the noise of their billows, || And the multitude of the peoples.
\v 8 And the inhabitants of the uttermost parts || Are afraid from Your signs, || You cause the outgoings of morning and evening to sing.
\v 9 You have inspected the earth, and water it, || You make it very rich, the stream of God [is] full of water, || You prepare their grain, || When thus You prepare it,
\v 10 Its ridges have been filled, || Its furrow has been deepened, || You soften it with showers, || Its springing up You bless.
\v 11 You have crowned the year of Your goodness, || And Your paths drop fatness.
\v 12 The pastures of a wilderness drop, || And You gird the hills with joy.
\v 13 The meadows are clothed with the flock, || And valleys are covered with grain, || They shout—indeed, they sing!
\c 66
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A SONG. A PSALM. Shout to God, all the earth.
\v 2 Praise the glory of His Name, || Make honorable His praise.
\v 3 Say to God, “How fearful Your works—By the abundance of Your strength, || Your enemies feign obedience to You.
\v 4 All the earth bows to You, || They sing praise to You, they praise Your Name.” Selah.
\v 5 Come, and see the works of God, || Fearful acts toward the sons of men.
\v 6 He has turned a sea to dry land, || Through a river they pass over on foot, || There we rejoice in Him.
\v 7 Ruling by His might for all time, || His eyes watch among the nations, || The stubborn do not exalt themselves. Selah.
\v 8 Bless our God you peoples, || And sound the voice of His praise,
\v 9 Who has placed our soul in life, || And has not permitted our feet to be moved.
\v 10 For You have tried us, O God, || You have refined us as the refining of silver.
\v 11 You have brought us into a net, || You have placed pressure on our loins.
\v 12 You have caused man to ride at our head. We have entered into fire and into water, || And You bring us out to a watered place.
\v 13 I enter Your house with burnt-offerings, || I complete my vows to You,
\v 14 For my lips were opened, || And my mouth spoke in my distress:
\v 15 “I offer to You burnt-offerings of fatlings, || With incense of rams, I prepare a bullock with male goats.” Selah.
\v 16 Come, hear, all you who fear God, || And I recount what He did for my soul.
\v 17 I have called to Him [with] my mouth, || And exaltation [is] under my tongue.
\v 18 Iniquity, if I have seen in my heart, || The Lord does not hear.
\v 19 But God has heard, || He has attended to the voice of my prayer.
\v 20 Blessed [is] God, || Who has not turned aside my prayer, || And His loving-kindness, from me!
\c 67
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. A PSALM. A SONG. God favors us and blesses us, || [And] causes His face to shine with us. Selah.
\v 2 For the knowledge of Your way in earth, || Your salvation among all nations.
\v 3 Peoples praise You, O God, || Peoples praise You, all of them.
\v 4 Nations rejoice and sing, || For You judge peoples uprightly, || And comfort peoples on earth. Selah.
\v 5 Peoples confess You, O God, || Peoples confess You—all of them.
\v 6 Earth has given her increase, God blesses us—our God,
\v 7 God blesses us, and all the ends of the earth fear Him!
\c 68
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM. A SONG OF DAVID. God rises [and] His enemies are scattered! And those hating Him flee from His face.
\v 2 You drive them away as the driving away of smoke, || As the melting of wax before fire, || The wicked perish at the presence of God.
\v 3 And the righteous rejoice, they exult before God, || And they rejoice with gladness.
\v 4 Sing to God—praise His Name, || Raise up a highway for Him who is riding in deserts, || In YAH [is] His Name, and exult before Him.
\v 5 Father of the fatherless, and judge of the widows, || [Is] God in His holy habitation.
\v 6 God—causing the lonely to dwell at home, || Bringing out bound ones into prosperity, || Only—the stubborn have inhabited a dry place.
\v 7 O God, in Your going forth before Your people, || In Your stepping through the wilderness, Selah.
\v 8 The earth has shaken, || Indeed, the heavens have dropped before God, || This Sinai—before God, the God of Israel.
\v 9 You shake out a shower of free-will gifts, O God. Your inheritance, when it has been weary, || You have established it.
\v 10 Your creature has dwelt in it, || You prepare for the poor in Your goodness, O God.
\v 11 The Lord gives the saying, || The female proclaimers [are] a numerous host.
\v 12 Kings of hosts utterly flee away, || And a female inhabitant of the house apportions spoil.
\v 13 Though you lie between two boundaries, || Wings of a dove covered with silver, || And her pinions with yellow gold.
\v 14 When the Mighty spreads kings in it, it snows in Salmon.
\v 15 A hill of God [is] the hill of Bashan, || A hill of heights [is] the hill of Bashan.
\v 16 Why do you envy, O high hills, || The hill God has desired for His seat? YHWH also dwells forever.
\v 17 The chariots of God [are] myriads, thousands of changes, || The Lord [is] among them, in Sinai, in the sanctuary.
\v 18 You have ascended on high, || You have taken captivity captive, || You have taken gifts for men, || That even the stubborn may rest, O YAH God.
\v 19 Blessed [is] the Lord, day by day He lays on us. God Himself [is] our salvation. Selah.
\v 20 God Himself [is] to us a God for deliverances, || And YHWH Lord has the outgoings of death.
\v 21 Only—God strikes || The head of His enemies, || The hairy crown of a habitual walker in his guilt.
\v 22 The Lord said: “From Bashan I bring back, || I bring back from the depths of the sea.
\v 23 So that you dash your foot || In the blood of enemies—the tongue of Your dogs.”
\v 24 They have seen Your goings, O God, || Goings of my God, my king, in the sanctuary.
\v 25 Singers have been before, || Behind [are] players on instruments, || Virgins playing with timbrels in the midst.
\v 26 In assemblies bless God, || The Lord—from the fountain of Israel.
\v 27 There [is] little Benjamin, their ruler, || Heads of Judah their defense, || Heads of Zebulun—heads of Naphtali.
\v 28 Your God has commanded your strength, || Be strong, O God, You have worked this for us.
\v 29 Because of Your temple at Jerusalem, || Kings bring a present to You.
\v 30 Rebuke a beast of the reeds, a herd of bulls, || With calves of the peoples, || Each humbling himself with pieces of silver, || You scatter peoples delighting in conflicts.
\v 31 Fat ones come out of Egypt, || Cush causes her hands to run to God.
\v 32 Kingdoms of the earth, sing to God, || Praise the Lord! Selah.
\v 33 To Him who is riding on the heavens of the heavens of old, || Behold, He gives with His voice a strong voice.
\v 34 Ascribe strength to God, || His excellence [is] over Israel, and His strength in the clouds.
\v 35 Fearful, O God, out of Your sanctuaries, || The God of Israel Himself, || Giving strength and might to the people. Blessed [is] God!
\c 69
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. [SET] ON “LILIES.” BY DAVID. Save me, O God, for waters have come to the soul.
\v 2 I have sunk in deep mire, || And there is no standing, || I have come into the depths of the waters, || And a flood has overflown me.
\v 3 I have been wearied with my calling, || My throat has been burned, || My eyes have been consumed, waiting for my God.
\v 4 Those hating me without cause || Have been more than the hairs of my head, || Mighty have been my destroyers, || My lying enemies, || That which I did not take away—I bring back.
\v 5 O God, You have known || Concerning my overturn, || And my desolations have not been hid from You.
\v 6 Do not let those waiting on You be ashamed because of me, || O Lord, YHWH of Hosts, || Do not let those seeking You || Blush because of me, || O God of Israel.
\v 7 For because of You I have borne reproach, || Shame has covered my face.
\v 8 I have been a stranger to my brother, || And a foreigner to sons of my mother.
\v 9 For [my] zeal for Your house has consumed me, || And the reproaches of Your reproachers || Have fallen on me.
\v 10 And I weep in the fasting of my soul, || And it is for a reproach to me.
\v 11 And I make my clothing sackcloth, || And I am for an allegory to them.
\v 12 Those sitting at the gate meditate concerning me, || And those drinking strong drink, || Play on instruments.
\v 13 And my prayer [is] to You, O YHWH, || A time of good pleasure, O God, || In the abundance of Your kindness, || Answer me in the truth of Your salvation.
\v 14 Deliver me from the mire, and do not let me sink, || Let me be delivered from those hating me, || And from deep places of waters.
\v 15 Do not let a flood of waters overflow me, || Nor let the deep swallow me up, || Nor let the pit shut her mouth on me.
\v 16 Answer me, O YHWH, for Your kindness [is] good, || Turn to me according to the abundance of Your mercies,
\v 17 And do not hide Your face from Your servant, || For I am in distress—hurry, answer me.
\v 18 Be near to my soul—redeem it, || Ransom me because of my enemies.
\v 19 You have known my reproach, || And my shame, and my blushing, || All my adversaries [are] before You.
\v 20 Reproach has broken my heart, and I am sick, || And I look for a bemoaner, and there is none, || And for comforters, and I have found none.
\v 21 And they give gall for my food, || And cause me to drink vinegar for my thirst.
\v 22 Their table before them is for a snare, || And for a repayment—for a trap.
\v 23 Their eyes are darkened from seeing, || And their loins continually shake You.
\v 24 Pour Your indignation on them, || And the fierceness of Your anger seizes them.
\v 25 Their tower is desolated, || There is no dweller in their tents.
\v 26 For they have pursued him [whom] You have struck, || And recount of the pain of Your pierced ones.
\v 27 Give punishment for their iniquity, || And they do not enter into Your righteousness.
\v 28 They are blotted out of the scroll of life, || And are not written with the righteous.
\v 29 And I [am] afflicted and pained, || Your salvation, O God, sets me on high.
\v 30 I praise the Name of God with a song, || And I magnify Him with thanksgiving,
\v 31 And it is better to YHWH than an ox, || A bullock—horned [and] hoofed.
\v 32 The humble have seen—they rejoice, || You who seek God—and your heart lives.
\v 33 For YHWH listens to the needy, || And He has not despised His bound ones.
\v 34 The heavens and earth praise Him, || Seas, and every moving thing in them.
\v 35 For God saves Zion, || And builds the cities of Judah, || And they have dwelt there, and possess it.
\v 36 And the seed of His servants inherit it, || And those loving His Name dwell in it!

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. BY DAVID. “TO CAUSE TO REMEMBER.” O God, [hurry] to deliver me, || O YHWH, hurry to help me.
\v 2 Let them be ashamed and confounded || Who are seeking my soul, || Let them be turned backward and blush || Who are desiring my evil.
\v 3 Let them turn back because of their shame, || Who are saying, “Aha, aha.”
\v 4 Let all those seeking You rejoice and be glad in You, || And let those loving Your salvation || Continually say, “God is magnified.”
\v 5 And I [am] poor and needy, O God, hurry to me, || You [are] my help and my deliverer, || O YHWH, do not linger!
\c 71
\p
\v 1 In You, O YHWH, I have trusted, || Do not let me be disappointed for all time.
\v 2 You deliver me in Your righteousness, || And cause me to escape, || Incline Your ear to me, and save me.
\v 3 Be a rock to me—a habitation, || To go in continually, || You have given command to save me, || For You [are] my rock and my bulwark.
\v 4 O my God, cause me to escape || From the hand of the wicked, || From the hand of the perverse and violent.
\v 5 For You [are] my hope, O Lord YHWH, || My trust from my youth.
\v 6 I have been supported from the womb by You, || You cut me out from my mother’s bowels, || My praise [is] continually in You.
\v 7 I have been as a wonder to many, || And You [are] my strong refuge.
\v 8 My mouth is filled [with] Your praise, || All the day [with] Your beauty.
\v 9 Do not cast me off at the time of old age, || Do not forsake me according to the consumption of my power.
\v 10 For my enemies have spoken against me, || And those watching my soul have taken counsel together,
\v 11 Saying, “God has forsaken him, || Pursue and catch him, for there is no deliverer.”
\v 12 O God, do not be far from me, || O my God, make haste for my help.
\v 13 They are ashamed, they are consumed, || Who are opposing my soul, || They are covered [with] reproach and blushing, || Who are seeking my evil,
\v 14 And I continually wait with hope, || And have added to all Your praise.
\v 15 My mouth recounts Your righteousness, || All the day Your salvation, || For I have not known the numbers.
\v 16 I come in [the] might of Lord YHWH, || I mention Your righteousness—Yours alone.
\v 17 God, You have taught me from my youth, || And until now I declare Your wonders.
\v 18 And also to old age and grey hairs, || O God, do not forsake me, || Until I declare Your strength to a generation, || Your might to everyone that comes.
\v 19 And Your righteousness, O God, [is] to the heights, || Because You have done great things, || O God, who [is] like You?
\v 20 Because You have showed me many and sad distresses, || You turn back—You revive me, || And from the depths of the earth, || You turn back—You bring me up.
\v 21 You increase my greatness, || And You surround—You comfort me,
\v 22 I also thank You with a vessel of stringed instrument, || Your truth, O my God, I sing to You with a harp, || O Holy One of Israel,
\v 23 My lips cry aloud when I sing praise to You, || And my soul that You have redeemed,
\v 24 My tongue also utters Your righteousness all the day, || Because ashamed—because confounded, || Have been those seeking my evil!
\c 72
\p
\v 1 BY SOLOMON. O God, give Your judgments to the king, || And Your righteousness to the king’s Son.
\v 2 He judges Your people with righteousness, || And Your poor with judgment.
\v 3 The mountains bear peace to the people, || And the heights by righteousness.
\v 4 He judges the poor of the people, || Gives deliverance to the sons of the needy, || And bruises the oppressor.
\v 5 They fear You with the sun, and before the moon, || Generation—generations.
\v 6 He comes down as rain on mown grass, || As showers—sprinkling the earth.
\v 7 The righteous flourish in His days, || And abundance of peace until the moon is not.
\v 8 And He rules from sea to sea, || And from the river to the ends of the earth.
\v 9 Desert-dwellers bow before Him, || And His enemies lick the dust.
\v 10 Kings of Tarshish and of the islands send back a present. Kings of Sheba and Seba bring a reward near.
\v 11 And all kings bow themselves to Him, || All nations serve Him,
\v 12 For He delivers the needy who cries, || And the poor when he has no helper,
\v 13 He has pity on the poor and needy, || And He saves the souls of the needy,
\v 14 He redeems their soul from fraud and from violence, || And their blood is precious in His eyes.
\v 15 And He lives, and the gold of Sheba [is] given to Him, || And prayer is continually made for Him, || All day He is continually blessed.
\v 16 There is a handful of grain in the earth, || On the top of mountains, || Its fruit shakes like Lebanon, || And they flourish out of the city as the herb of the earth.
\v 17 His Name is for all time, || Before the sun is His Name continued, || And they bless themselves in Him, || All nations pronounce Him blessed.
\v 18 Blessed is YHWH God, God of Israel, || He alone is doing wonders,
\v 19 And blessed [is] the Name of His glory for all time, || And the whole earth is filled [with] His glory. Amen and amen!
\v 20 The prayers of David son of Jesse have been ended.

\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF ASAPH. Surely God [is] good to Israel, to the clean of heart. And I—as a little thing, || My feet have been turned aside,
\v 2 As nothing, my steps have slipped, || For I have been envious of the boastful,
\v 3 I see the peace of the wicked, || That there are no bands at their death,
\v 4 And their might [is] firm.
\v 5 They are not in the misery of mortals, || And they are not plagued with common men.
\v 6 Therefore pride has encircled them, || Violence covers them as a dress.
\v 7 Their eye has come out from fat. The imaginations of the heart transgressed;
\v 8 They do corruptly, || And they speak in the wickedness of oppression, || They speak from on high.
\v 9 They have set their mouth in the heavens, || And their tongue walks in the earth.
\v 10 Therefore His people return here, || And waters of fullness are wrung out to them.
\v 11 And they have said, “How has God known? And is there knowledge in the Most High?”
\v 12 Behold, these [are] the wicked and easy ones of the age, || They have increased strength.
\v 13 Only—a vain thing! I have purified my heart, || And I wash my hands in innocence,
\v 14 And I am plagued all the day, || And my reproof—every morning.
\v 15 If I have said, “I recount thus,” || Behold, I have deceived a generation of Your sons.
\v 16 And I think to know this, || It [is] perverseness in my eyes,
\v 17 Until I come into the sanctuaries of God, || I attend to their latter end.
\v 18 Surely You set them in slippery places, || You have caused them to fall to desolations.
\v 19 How they have become a desolation as in a moment, || They have been ended—consumed from terrors.
\v 20 As a dream from awakening, O Lord, || In awaking, You despise their image.
\v 21 For my heart shows itself violent, || And my reins prick themselves,
\v 22 And I am brutish, and do not know. I have been a beast with You.
\v 23 And I [am] continually with You, || You have laid hold on my right hand.
\v 24 You lead me with Your counsel, || And after, receive me [to] glory.
\v 25 Whom do I have in the heavens? And none have I desired in earth [besides] You.
\v 26 My flesh and my heart have been consumed, || God [is] the rock of my heart and my portion for all time.
\v 27 For behold, those far from You perish, || You have cut off everyone, || Who is going whoring from You.
\v 28 And [the] nearness of God to me [is] good, || I have placed my refuge in Lord YHWH, || To recount all Your works!
\c 74
\p
\v 1 AN INSTRUCTION OF ASAPH. Why, O God, have You cast off forever? Your anger smokes against the flock of Your pasture.
\v 2 Remember Your congregation || [That] You purchased of old, || You redeemed the rod of Your inheritance, || This Mount Zion—You dwelt in it.
\v 3 Lift up Your steps to the continuous desolations, || Everything the enemy did wickedly in the sanctuary.
\v 4 Your adversaries have roared, || In the midst of Your meeting-places, || They have set their ensigns as ensigns.
\v 5 He is known as one bringing in on high || Against a thicket of wood—axes.
\v 6 And now they break down its engravings, || Together, with axe and hatchet,
\v 7 They have sent Your sanctuary into fire, || They defiled the Dwelling Place of Your Name to the earth,
\v 8 They said in their hearts, “Let us oppress them together,” || They burned all the meeting-places of God in the land.
\v 9 We have not seen our ensigns, || There is no longer a prophet, || Nor with us is one knowing how long.
\v 10 Until when, O God, does an adversary reproach? Does an enemy despise Your Name forever?
\v 11 Why do You turn back Your hand, || Even Your right hand? Remove [it] from the midst of Your bosom.
\v 12 And God [is] my king of old, || Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
\v 13 You have divided [the] sea by Your strength, || You have shattered heads of dragons by the waters,
\v 14 You have broken the heads of leviathan, || You make him food for the people of desert-dwellers.
\v 15 You have cleaved a fountain and a stream, || You have dried up perennial flowings.
\v 16 The day [is] Yours, || The night [is] also Yours, || You have prepared a light-giver—the sun.
\v 17 You have set up all the borders of earth, || Summer and winter—You have formed them.
\v 18 Remember this—an enemy reproached YHWH, || And a foolish people have despised Your Name.
\v 19 Do not give up to a [wild] creature, || The soul of Your turtle-dove, || Do not forget the life of Your poor ones forever.
\v 20 Look attentively to the covenant, || For the dark places of earth, || Have been full of habitations of violence.
\v 21 Do not let the oppressed turn back ashamed, || Let the poor and needy praise Your Name,
\v 22 Arise, O God, plead Your plea, || Remember Your reproach from a fool all the day.
\v 23 Do not forget the voice of Your adversaries, || The noise of Your withstanders is going up continually!

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. “DO NOT DESTROY.” A PSALM OF ASAPH. A SONG. We have given thanks to You, O God, || We have given thanks, and Your Name [is] near, || They have recounted Your wonders.
\v 2 When I receive an appointment, I judge uprightly.
\v 3 The earth and all its inhabitants are melted, || I have pondered its pillars. Selah.
\v 4 I have said to the boastful, “Do not be boastful,” || And to the wicked, “Do not raise up a horn.”
\v 5 Do not raise up your horn on high || (You speak with a stiff neck).
\v 6 For not from the east, or from the west, || Nor from the wilderness—[is] elevation.
\v 7 But God [is] judging, || This He makes low—and this He lifts up.
\v 8 For a cup [is] in the hand of YHWH, || And the wine has foamed, || It is full of mixture, and He pours out of it, || Surely wring out its dregs, || And all the wicked of the earth drink,
\v 9 And I declare [it] for all time, || I sing praise to the God of Jacob.
\v 10 And I cut off all horns of the wicked, || The horns of the righteous are exalted!
\c 76

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. A PSALM OF ASAPH. A SONG. God [is] known in Judah, || His Name [is] great in Israel.
\v 2 And His dwelling place is in Salem, || And His habitation in Zion.
\v 3 There He has shattered arrows of a bow, || Shield, and sword, and battle. Selah.
\v 4 You [are] bright, majestic above hills of prey.
\v 5 The mighty of heart have spoiled themselves, || They have slept their sleep, || And none of the men of might found their hands.
\v 6 From Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, || Both rider and horse have been fast asleep.
\v 7 You, fearful [are] You, || And who stands before You, || Since You have been angry?
\v 8 You have sounded judgment from the heavens, || Earth has feared, and has been still,
\v 9 In the rising of God to judgment, || To save all the humble of earth. Selah.
\v 10 For the fierceness of man praises You, || You gird on the remnant of fierceness.
\v 11 Vow and complete to your God YHWH, || All you surrounding Him, || They bring presents to the Fearful One.
\v 12 He gathers the spirit of leaders, || Fearful to the kings of earth!
\c 77

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. FOR JEDUTHUN. A PSALM OF ASAPH. My voice [is] to God, and I cry, || My voice [is] to God, || And He has given ear to me.
\v 2 I sought the Lord in a day of my distress, || My hand has been spread out by night, || And it does not cease, || My soul has refused to be comforted.
\v 3 I remember God, and make a noise, || I meditate, and my spirit is feeble. Selah.
\v 4 You have taken hold of the watches of my eyes, || I have been moved, and I do not speak.
\v 5 I have reckoned the days of old, || The years of the ages.
\v 6 I remember my music in the night, || I meditate with my heart, and my spirit searches diligently:
\v 7 Does the Lord cast off for all ages? Does He add to be pleased no longer?
\v 8 Has His kindness ceased forever? The saying failed from generation to generation?
\v 9 Has God forgotten [His] favors? Has He shut up His mercies in anger? Selah.
\v 10 And I say: “My weakness is, || The changes of the right hand of the Most High.”
\v 11 I mention the doings of YAH, || For I remember Your wonders of old,
\v 12 And I have meditated on all Your working, || And I talk concerning Your doings.
\v 13 O God, Your way [is] in holiness, || Who [is] a great god like God?
\v 14 You [are] the God doing wonders. You have made Your strength known among the peoples,
\v 15 You have redeemed Your people with strength, || The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
\v 16 The waters have seen You, O God, || The waters have seen You, || They are afraid—also depths are troubled.
\v 17 Thick clouds have poured out waters, || The skies have given forth a noise, || Also—Your arrows go up and down.
\v 18 The voice of Your thunder [is] in the spheres, || Lightnings have lightened the world, || The earth has trembled, indeed, it shakes.
\v 19 Your way [is] in the sea, || And Your paths in many waters, || And Your tracks have not been known.
\v 20 You have led Your people as a flock, || By the hand of Moses and Aaron!
\c 78
\p
\v 1 AN INSTRUCTION OF ASAPH. Give ear, O my people, to my law, || Incline your ear to sayings of my mouth.
\v 2 I open my mouth with an allegory, || I bring forth hidden things of old,
\v 3 That we have heard and know, || And our fathers have recounted to us.
\v 4 We do not hide from their sons, || Recounting praises of YHWH to a later generation, || And His strength, and His wonders that He has done.
\v 5 And He raises up a testimony in Jacob, || And has placed a law in Israel, || That He commanded our fathers, || To make them known to their sons.
\v 6 So that a later generation knows, || Sons who are born, rise and recount to their sons,
\v 7 And place their confidence in God, || And do not forget the doings of God, || But keep His commands.
\v 8 And they are not like their fathers, || A generation apostatizing and being rebellious, || A generation—it has not prepared its heart, || Nor [is] its spirit steadfast with God.
\v 9 Sons of Ephraim—armed bearers of bow, || Have turned in a day of conflict.
\v 10 They have not kept the covenant of God, || And they have refused to walk in His law,
\v 11 And they forget His doings, || And His wonders that He showed them.
\v 12 He has done wonders before their fathers, || In the land of Egypt—the field of Zoan.
\v 13 He cleft a sea, and causes them to pass over, || Indeed, He causes waters to stand as a heap.
\v 14 And leads them with a cloud by day, || And with a light of fire all the night.
\v 15 He cleaves rocks in a wilderness, || And gives drink—as the great deep.
\v 16 And brings out streams from a rock, || And causes waters to come down as rivers.
\v 17 And they still add to sin against Him, || To provoke the Most High in the dry place.
\v 18 And they try God in their heart, || To ask food for their lust.
\v 19 And they speak against God—they said: “Is God able to array a table in a wilderness?”
\v 20 Behold, He has struck a rock, || And waters flow, indeed, streams overflow. “Also, [is] He able to give bread? Does He prepare flesh for His people?”
\v 21 Therefore YHWH has heard, || And He shows Himself angry, || And fire has been kindled against Jacob, || And anger has also gone up against Israel,
\v 22 For they have not believed in God, || Nor have they trusted in His salvation.
\v 23 And He commands clouds from above, || Indeed, He has opened doors of the heavens.
\v 24 And He rains manna on them to eat, || Indeed, He has given grain of the heavens to them.
\v 25 Each has eaten food of the mighty, || He sent provision to them to satiety.
\v 26 He causes an east wind to journey in the heavens, || And leads a south wind by His strength,
\v 27 And He rains on them flesh as dust, || And as sand of the seas—winged bird,
\v 28 And causes [it] to fall in the midst of His camp, || Around His dwelling places.
\v 29 And they eat, and are greatly satisfied, || And He brings their desire to them.
\v 30 They have not been estranged from their desire, || Their food [is] yet in their mouth,
\v 31 And the anger of God has gone up against them, || And He slays among their fat ones, || And He caused youths of Israel to bend.
\v 32 With all this they have sinned again, || And have not believed in His wonders.
\v 33 And He consumes their days in vanity, || And their years in trouble.
\v 34 If He slew them, then they sought Him, || And turned back, and earnestly sought God,
\v 35 And they remember that God [is] their rock, || And God Most High their redeemer.
\v 36 And they deceive Him with their mouth, || And lie to Him with their tongue,
\v 37 And their heart has not been right with Him, || And they have not been steadfast in His covenant.
\v 38 And He, the Merciful One, pardons iniquity, and does not destroy, || And has often turned back His anger, || And does not awaken all His fury.
\v 39 And He remembers that they [are] flesh, || A wind going on—and it does not return.
\v 40 How often do they provoke Him in the wilderness, || Grieve Him in the desolate place?
\v 41 Indeed, they turn back, and try God, || And have limited the Holy One of Israel.
\v 42 They have not remembered His hand || The day He ransomed them from the adversary.
\v 43 When He set His signs in Egypt, || And His wonders in the field of Zoan,
\v 44 And He turns their streams to blood, || And they do not drink their floods.
\v 45 He sends among them the beetle, and it consumes them, || And the frog, and it destroys them,
\v 46 And gives their increase to the caterpillar, || And their labor to the locust.
\v 47 He destroys their vine with hail, || And their sycamores with frost,
\v 48 And delivers their beasts up to the hail, || And their livestock to the burning flames.
\v 49 He sends on them the fury of His anger, || Wrath, and indignation, and distress—A discharge of evil messengers.
\v 50 He ponders a path for His anger, || He did not keep back their soul from death, || Indeed, He delivered up their life to the pestilence.
\v 51 And He strikes every firstborn in Egypt, || The first-fruit of the strong in tents of Ham.
\v 52 And causes His people to journey as a flock, || And guides them as a drove in a wilderness,
\v 53 And He leads them confidently, || And they have not been afraid, || And the sea has covered their enemies.
\v 54 And He brings them to the border of His sanctuary, || This mountain His right hand had acquired,
\v 55 And casts out nations from before them, || And causes them to fall in the line of inheritance, || And causes the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents,
\v 56 And they tempt and provoke God Most High, || And have not kept His testimonies.
\v 57 And they turn back, || And deal treacherously like their fathers, || They have been turned like a deceitful bow,
\v 58 And make Him angry with their high places, || And make Him zealous with their carved images,
\v 59 God has heard, and shows Himself angry. And kicks exceedingly against Israel.
\v 60 And He leaves the Dwelling Place of Shiloh, || The tent He had placed among men,
\v 61 And He gives His strength to captivity, || And His beauty into the hand of an adversary,
\v 62 And delivers His people up to the sword, || And showed Himself angry with His inheritance.
\v 63 Fire has consumed His young men, || And His virgins have not been praised.
\v 64 His priests have fallen by the sword, || And their widows do not weep.
\v 65 And the Lord wakes as a sleeper, || As a mighty one crying aloud from wine.
\v 66 And He strikes His adversaries backward, || He has put a continuous reproach on them,
\v 67 And He kicks against the tent of Joseph, || And has not fixed on the tribe of Ephraim.
\v 68 And He chooses the tribe of Judah, || With Mount Zion that He loved,
\v 69 And builds His sanctuary as a high place, || Like the earth, He founded it for all time.
\v 70 And He fixes on His servant David, || And takes him from the folds of a flock,
\v 71 He has brought him in from behind suckling ones, || To rule over Jacob His people, || And over Israel His inheritance.
\v 72 And he rules them according to the integrity of his heart, || And leads them by the skillfulness of his hands!
\c 79
\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF ASAPH. O God, nations have come into Your inheritance, || They have defiled Your holy temple, || They made Jerusalem become heaps,
\v 2 They gave the dead bodies of Your servants || [As] food for the birds of the heavens, || The flesh of Your saints || For the wild beast of the earth.
\v 3 They have shed their blood || As water around Jerusalem, || And there is none burying.
\v 4 We have been a reproach to our neighbors, || A scorn and a derision to our surrounders.
\v 5 Until when, O YHWH? Are You angry forever? Your jealousy burns as fire.
\v 6 Pour Your fury on the nations who have not known You, || And on kingdoms that have not called on Your Name.
\v 7 For [one] has devoured Jacob, || And they have made his habitation desolate.
\v 8 Do not remember for us the iniquities of forefathers, || Hurry, let Your mercies go before us, || For we have been very weak.
\v 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, || Because of the glory of Your Name, || And deliver us, and cover over our sins, || For Your Name’s sake.
\v 10 Why do the nations say, “Where [is] their God?” Let [it] be known among the nations before our eyes, || The vengeance of the blood of Your servants that is shed.
\v 11 Let the groaning of the prisoner come in before You, || According to the greatness of Your arm, || Leave the sons of death.
\v 12 And return to our neighbors, || Sevenfold to their bosom, their reproach, || With which they reproached You, O Lord.
\v 13 And we, Your people, and the flock of Your pasture, || We give thanks to You for all time, || We recount Your praise from generation to generation!

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. [SET] TO “LILIES OF TESTIMONY.” A PSALM OF ASAPH. Shepherd of Israel, give ear, || Leading Joseph as a flock, || Inhabiting the cherubim—shine forth,
\v 2 Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, || Wake up Your might, and come for our salvation.
\v 3 O God, cause us to turn back, || And cause Your face to shine, and we are saved.
\v 4 YHWH, God of Hosts, until when? You have burned against the prayer of Your people.
\v 5 You have caused them to eat bread of tears, || And cause them to drink || With tears a third time.
\v 6 You make us a strife to our neighbors, || And our enemies mock at it.
\v 7 God of Hosts, turn us back, || And cause Your face to shine, and we are saved.
\v 8 You bring a vine out of Egypt, || You cast out nations, and plant it.
\v 9 You have looked before it, and root it, || And it fills the land,
\v 10 Hills have been covered [with] its shadow, || And its boughs [are] cedars of God.
\v 11 It sends forth its branches to the sea, || And its shoots to the river.
\v 12 Why have You broken down its hedges, || And everyone passing by the way has plucked it?
\v 13 A boar out of the forest tears it, || And a wild beast of the fields grazes it.
\v 14 God of Hosts, turn back, we implore You, || Look from the heavens, and see, and inspect this vine,
\v 15 And the root that Your right hand planted, || And the branch You made strong for Yourself,
\v 16 Burned with fire—cut down, || They perish from the rebuke of Your face.
\v 17 Let Your hand be on the man of Your right hand || On the son of man You have strengthened for Yourself.
\v 18 And we do not go back from You, || You revive us, and in Your Name we call.
\v 19 O YHWH, God of Hosts, turn us back, || Cause Your face to shine, and we are saved!

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. ON THE GITTITH. BY ASAPH. Cry aloud to God our strength, || Shout to the God of Jacob.
\v 2 Lift up a song, and give out a timbrel, || A pleasant harp with stringed instrument.
\v 3 Blow a horn in the month, || In the new moon, at the day of our festival,
\v 4 For it [is] a statute to Israel, || An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
\v 5 He has placed it—a testimony on Joseph, || In his going forth over the land of Egypt. A lip, I have not known—I hear.
\v 6 I turned aside his shoulder from the burden, || His hands pass over from the basket.
\v 7 In distress you have called and I deliver you, || I answer you in the secret place of thunder, || I try you by the waters of Meribah. Selah.
\v 8 Hear, O My people, and I testify to you, || O Israel, if you listen to me:
\v 9 There is not in you a strange god, || And you do not bow yourself to a strange god.
\v 10 I [am] your God YHWH, || Who brings you up out of the land of Egypt. Enlarge your mouth, and I fill it.
\v 11 But My people did not listen to My voice, || And Israel has not consented to Me.
\v 12 And I send them away in the enmity of their heart, || They walk in their own counsels.
\v 13 O that My people were listening to Me, || Israel would walk in My ways.
\v 14 As a little thing I cause their enemies to bow, || And I turn back My hand against their adversaries,
\v 15 Those hating YHWH should have feigned [obedience] to Him, || And their time would last for all time.
\v 16 He causes him to eat of the fat of wheat, || And I satisfy you [with] honey from a rock!
\c 82
\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF ASAPH. God has stood in the congregation of God, || He judges among the gods.
\v 2 Until when do you judge perversely? And lift up the face of the wicked? Selah.
\v 3 Judge the weak and fatherless, || Declare the afflicted and the poor righteous.
\v 4 Let the weak and needy escape, || Deliver them from the hand of the wicked.
\v 5 They did not know, nor do they understand, || They habitually walk in darkness, || All the foundations of earth are moved.
\v 6 I have said, “You [are] gods, || And sons of the Most High—all of you,
\v 7 But you die as man, and you fall as one of the heads.”
\v 8 Rise, O God, judge the earth, || For You have inheritance among all the nations!
\c 83
\p
\v 1 A SONG. A PSALM OF ASAPH. O God, let there be no silence to You, || Do not be silent, nor be quiet, O God.
\v 2 For behold, Your enemies roar, || And those hating You have lifted up the head,
\v 3 They take crafty counsel against Your people, || And consult against Your hidden ones.
\v 4 They have said, “Come, and we cut them off from [being] a nation, || And the name of Israel is not remembered anymore.”
\v 5 For they consulted in heart together, || They make a covenant against You,
\v 6 Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes,
\v 7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with inhabitants of Tyre,
\v 8 Asshur is also joined with them, || They have been an arm to sons of Lot. Selah.
\v 9 Do to them as Midian, || As Sisera, as Jabin, at the Brook of Kishon.
\v 10 They were destroyed at Endor, || They were dung for the ground!
\v 11 Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb, || And as Zebah and Zalmunna—all their princes,
\v 12 Who have said, “Let us occupy the pastures of God for ourselves.”
\v 13 O my God, make them as a rolling thing, || As stubble before wind.
\v 14 As a fire burns a forest, || And as a flame sets hills on fire,
\v 15 So You pursue them with Your whirlwind, || And trouble them with Your windstorm.
\v 16 Fill their faces [with] shame, || And they seek Your Name, O YHWH.
\v 17 They are ashamed and troubled forever, || Indeed, they are confounded and lost.
\v 18 And they know that You—Your Name [is] YHWH—By Yourself [are] the Most High over all the earth!

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. ON THE GITTITH. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. How beloved Your dwelling places, YHWH of Hosts!
\v 2 My soul desired, indeed, it has also been consumed, || For the courts of YHWH, || My heart and my flesh cry aloud to the living God,
\v 3 Even a sparrow has found a house, || And a swallow a nest for herself, || Where she has placed her brood—Your altars, O YHWH of Hosts, || My king and my God.
\v 4 O the blessedness of those inhabiting Your house, || Yet they praise You. Selah.
\v 5 O the blessedness of a man whose strength is in You, || Highways [are] in their heart.
\v 6 Those passing through a valley of weeping make it a spring, || The early rain covers it with pools.
\v 7 They go from strength to strength, || He appears to God in Zion.
\v 8 O YHWH, God of Hosts, hear my prayer, || Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
\v 9 Our shield, see, O God, || And behold the face of Your anointed,
\v 10 For a day in Your courts [is] good, O Teacher! I have chosen rather to be at the threshold, || In the house of my God, || Than to dwell in tents of wickedness.
\v 11 For YHWH God [is] a sun and a shield, || YHWH gives grace and glory. He does not withhold good || To those walking in uprightness.
\v 12 YHWH of Hosts! O the blessedness of a man trusting in You.
\c 85

\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. You have accepted, O YHWH, Your land, || You have turned [to] the captivity of Jacob.
\v 2 You have carried away the iniquity of Your people, || You have covered all their sin. Selah.
\v 3 You have gathered up all Your wrath, || You have turned back from the fierceness of Your anger.
\v 4 Turn back [to] us, O God of our salvation, || And make void Your anger with us.
\v 5 Are You angry against us for all time? Do You draw out Your anger || To generation and generation?
\v 6 Do You not turn back? You revive us, || And Your people rejoice in You.
\v 7 Show us, O YHWH, your kindness, || And You give to us Your salvation.
\v 8 I hear what God, YHWH, speaks, || For He speaks peace to His people, || And to His saints, and they do not turn back to folly.
\v 9 Surely His salvation [is] near to those fearing Him, || That glory may dwell in our land.
\v 10 Kindness and truth have met, || Righteousness and peace have kissed,
\v 11 Truth springs up from the earth, || And righteousness looks out from the heavens,
\v 12 YHWH also gives that which is good, || And our land gives its increase.
\v 13 Righteousness goes before Him, || And makes a way for His footsteps!
\c 86

\v 1 A PRAYER OF DAVID. Incline, O YHWH, Your ear, || Answer me, for I [am] poor and needy.
\v 2 Keep my soul, for I [am] pious, || Save Your servant who is trusting to You, O You, my God.
\v 3 Favor me, O Lord, for I call to You all the day.
\v 4 Make glad the soul of Your servant, || For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
\v 5 For You, Lord, [are] good and forgiving, || And abundant in kindness to all calling You.
\v 6 Hear, O YHWH, my prayer, || And attend to the voice of my supplications.
\v 7 In a day of my distress I call You, || For You answer me.
\v 8 There is none like You among the gods, O Lord, || And like Your works there are none.
\v 9 All nations that You have made || Come and bow themselves before You, O Lord, || And give honor to Your Name.
\v 10 For You [are] great, and doing wonders, || You [are] God alone.
\v 11 Show me, O YHWH, Your way, || I walk in Your truth, || My heart rejoices to fear Your Name.
\v 12 I confess You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, || And I honor Your Name for all time.
\v 13 For Your kindness [is] great toward me, || And You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
\v 14 O God, the proud have risen up against me, || And a company of the terrible sought my soul, || And have not placed You before them,
\v 15 And You, O Lord, [are] God, merciful and gracious, || Slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth.
\v 16 Look to me, and favor me, || Give Your strength to Your servant, || And give salvation to a son of Your handmaid.
\v 17 Do with me a sign for good, || And those hating me see and are ashamed, || For You, O YHWH, have helped me, || Indeed, You have comforted me!

\v 1 A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. A SONG. His foundation [is] in holy mountains.
\v 2 YHWH is loving the gates of Zion || Above all the dwelling places of Jacob.
\v 3 Honorable things are spoken in You, || O city of God. Selah.
\v 4 I mention Rahab and Babel to those knowing Me, || Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush! This [one] was born there.
\v 5 And of Zion it is said: Each one was born in her, || And He, the Most High, establishes her.
\v 6 YHWH recounts in the describing of the peoples, “This [one] was born there.” Selah.
\v 7 Also singers as players on instruments, || All my fountains [are] in You!

\v 1 A SONG. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. TO THE OVERSEER. [SET] ON “SICKNESS TO AFFLICT.” AN INSTRUCTION OF HEMAN THE EZRAHITE. O YHWH, God of my salvation, || Daily I have cried, nightly before You,
\v 2 My prayer comes in before You, || Incline Your ear to my loud cry,
\v 3 For my soul has been full of evils, || And my life has come to Sheol.
\v 4 I have been reckoned with those going down [to] the pit, || I have been as a man without strength.
\v 5 Among the dead—free, || As pierced ones lying in the grave, || Whom You have not remembered anymore, || Indeed, they have been cut off by Your hand.
\v 6 You have put me in the lowest pit, || In dark places, in depths.
\v 7 Your fury has lain on me, || And You have afflicted [with] all Your breakers. Selah.
\v 8 You have put my acquaintance far from me, || You have made me an abomination to them, || Shut up—I do not go forth.
\v 9 My eye has grieved because of affliction, || I called You, O YHWH, all the day, || I have spread out my hands to You.
\v 10 Do You do wonders to the dead? Does Rephaim rise? Do they thank You? Selah.
\v 11 Is Your kindness recounted in the grave? Your faithfulness in destruction?
\v 12 Are Your wonders known in the darkness? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
\v 13 And I, to You, O YHWH, I have cried, || And in the morning my prayer comes before You.
\v 14 Why, O YHWH, do You cast off my soul? You hide Your face from me.
\v 15 I [am] afflicted, and expiring from youth, || I have borne Your terrors—I pine away.
\v 16 Your wrath has passed over me, || Your terrors have cut me off,
\v 17 They have surrounded me as waters all the day, || They have gone around against me together,
\v 18 You have put lover and friend far from me, || My acquaintance [is] the place of darkness!
\c 89
\p
\v 1 AN INSTRUCTION OF ETHAN THE EZRAHITE. Of the kind acts of YHWH, I sing for all time, || From generation to generation I make known Your faithfulness with my mouth,
\v 2 For I said, “Kindness is built for all time, || The heavens! You establish Your faithfulness in them.”
\v 3 I have made a covenant for My chosen, || I have sworn to My servant David:
\v 4 “Even for all time I establish your seed, || And have built your throne to generation and generation.” Selah.
\v 5 And the heavens confess Your wonders, O YHWH, || Your faithfulness [is] also in an assembly of holy ones.
\v 6 For who in the sky, compares himself to YHWH? [Who] is like to YHWH among sons of the mighty?
\v 7 God is very terrible, || In the secret counsel of His holy ones, || And fearful over all surrounding Him.
\v 8 O YHWH, God of Hosts, || Who [is] like You—a strong YAH? And Your faithfulness [is] around You.
\v 9 You [are] ruler over the pride of the sea, || In the lifting up of its billows You restrain them.
\v 10 You have bruised Rahab, as one wounded. You have scattered Your enemies with the arm of Your strength.
\v 11 The heavens [are] Yours, || The earth [is] also Yours, || The habitable world and its fullness, || You have founded them.
\v 12 North and south You have appointed them, || Tabor and Hermon sing in Your Name.
\v 13 You have an arm with might, || Strong is Your hand—high Your right hand.
\v 14 Righteousness and judgment || [Are] the fixed place of Your throne, || Kindness and truth go before Your face.
\v 15 O the blessedness of the people knowing the shout, || O YHWH, they habitually walk in the light of Your face.
\v 16 They rejoice in Your Name all the day, || And they are exalted in Your righteousness,
\v 17 For You [are] the beauty of their strength, || And in Your good will is our horn exalted,
\v 18 For our shield [is] of YHWH, || And our king to the Holy One of Israel.
\v 19 Then You have spoken in vision, || To Your saint, indeed, || You say, I have placed help on a mighty one, || Exalted a chosen one out of the people,
\v 20 I have found My servant David, || With My holy oil I have anointed him.
\v 21 With whom My hand is established, || My arm also strengthens him.
\v 22 An enemy does not exact on him, || And a son of perverseness does not afflict him.
\v 23 And I have beaten down his adversaries before him, || And I plague those hating him,
\v 24 And My faithfulness and kindness [are] with him, || And in My Name is his horn exalted.
\v 25 And I have set his hand on the sea, || And his right hand on the rivers.
\v 26 He proclaims to Me: “You [are] my Father, || My God, and the rock of my salvation.”
\v 27 I also appoint him firstborn, || Highest of the kings of the earth.
\v 28 For all time I keep for him My kindness, || And My covenant [is] steadfast with him.
\v 29 And I have set his seed forever, || And his throne as the days of the heavens.
\v 30 If his sons forsake My law, || And do not walk in My judgments;
\v 31 If they defile My statutes, || And do not keep My commands,
\v 32 I have looked after their transgression with a rod, || And their iniquity with strokes,
\v 33 And I do not break My kindness from him, || Nor do I deal falsely in My faithfulness.
\v 34 I do not profane My covenant, || And I do not change that which is going forth from My lips.
\v 35 Once I have sworn by My holiness, || I do not lie to David,
\v 36 His seed is for all time, || And his throne [is] as the sun before Me,
\v 37 It is established as the moon for all time, || And the witness in the sky is steadfast. Selah.
\v 38 And You, You have cast off, and reject, || You have shown Yourself angry with Your anointed,
\v 39 Have rejected the covenant of Your servant, || You have defiled his crown to the earth,
\v 40 You have broken down all his hedges, || You have made his fortifications a ruin.
\v 41 Everyone passing by the way has spoiled him, || He has been a reproach to his neighbors,
\v 42 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries, || You have caused all his enemies to rejoice.
\v 43 Also—You turn back the sharpness of his sword, || And have not established him in battle,
\v 44 Have caused [him] to cease from his brightness, || And have cast down his throne to the earth.
\v 45 You have shortened the days of his youth, || Have covered him over [with] shame. Selah.
\v 46 Until when, O YHWH, are You hidden? Does Your fury burn as fire forever?
\v 47 Remember how [short] my lifetime [is]. Why have You created in vain || All the sons of men?
\v 48 Who [is] the man that lives, and does not see death? He delivers his soul from the hand of Sheol. Selah.
\v 49 Where [are] Your former kindnesses, O Lord, || [Which] You have sworn to David in Your faithfulness?
\v 50 Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, || I have borne in my bosom all the strivings of the peoples,
\v 51 With which Your enemies reproached, O YHWH, || With which they have reproached || The steps of Your anointed.
\v 52 Blessed [is] YHWH for all time. Amen and amen!

\v 1 A PRAYER OF MOSES, THE MAN OF GOD. Lord, You have been a habitation, || To us—in generation and generation,
\v 2 Before mountains were brought forth, || And You form the earth and the world, || Even from age to age You [are] God.
\v 3 You turn man to a bruised thing, || And say, Return, you sons of men.
\v 4 For one thousand years in Your eyes [are] as yesterday, || For it passes on, indeed, [as] a watch by night.
\v 5 You have inundated them, they are asleep, || In the morning he changes as grass.
\v 6 In the morning it flourishes, and has changed, || At evening it is cut down, and has withered.
\v 7 For we were consumed in Your anger, || And we have been troubled in Your fury.
\v 8 You have set our iniquities before You, || Our hidden things at the light of Your face,
\v 9 For all our days pined away in Your wrath, || We consumed our years as a meditation.
\v 10 The days of our years, in them [are] seventy years, || And if, by reason of might, eighty years, || Yet their enlargement [is] labor and vanity, || For it has been cut off quickly, and we fly away.
\v 11 Who knows the power of Your anger? And according to Your fear—Your wrath?
\v 12 Let [us] know to number our days correctly, || And we bring the heart to wisdom.
\v 13 Turn back, O YHWH, until when? And regret concerning Your servants.
\v 14 Satisfy us at morning [with] Your kindness, || And we sing and rejoice all our days.
\v 15 Cause us to rejoice according to the days || Wherein You have afflicted us, || The years we have seen evil.
\v 16 Let Your work appear to Your servants, || And Your honor on their sons.
\v 17 And let the pleasantness of our God YHWH be on us, || And establish on us the work of our hands, || Indeed, establish the work of our hands!
\c 91
\p
\v 1 He who is dwelling || In the secret place of the Most High, || Habitually lodges in the shade of the Mighty,
\v 2 He is saying of YHWH, “My refuge, and my bulwark, my God, I trust in Him,”
\v 3 For He delivers you from the snare of a fowler, || From a calamitous pestilence.
\v 4 He covers you over with His pinion, || And under His wings you trust, || His truth [is] a shield and buckler.
\v 5 You are not afraid of fear by night, || Of arrow that flies by day,
\v 6 Of pestilence that walks in thick darkness, || Of destruction that destroys at noon,
\v 7 One thousand fall at your side, || And a myriad at your right hand, || [But] it does not come near to you.
\v 8 But with your eyes you look, || And you see the reward of the wicked,
\v 9 (For You, O YHWH, [are] my refuge), || You made the Most High your habitation.
\v 10 Evil does not happen to you, || And a plague does not come near your tent,
\v 11 For He charges His messengers for you, || To keep you in all your ways,
\v 12 On the hands they bear you up, || Lest you strike your foot against a stone.
\v 13 You tread on lion and cobra, || You trample young lion and dragon.
\v 14 Because he has delighted in Me, || I also deliver him—I set him on high, || Because he has known My Name.
\v 15 He calls Me, and I answer him, || I [am] with him in distress, || I deliver him, and honor him.
\v 16 I satisfy him with [the] length of [his] days, || And I cause him to look on My salvation!
\c 92
\p
\v 1 A PSALM. A SONG FOR THE SABBATH DAY. [It is] good to give thanks to YHWH, || And to sing praises to Your Name, O Most High,
\v 2 To declare Your kindness in the morning, || And Your faithfulness in the nights.
\v 3 On ten strings and on stringed instrument, || On higgaion, with harp.
\v 4 For You have caused me to rejoice, O YHWH, in Your work, || I sing concerning the works of Your hands.
\v 5 How great Your works have been, O YHWH, || Your thoughts have been very deep.
\v 6 A brutish man does not know, || And a fool does not understand this—
\v 7 When the wicked flourish as an herb, || And all workers of iniquity blossom—For their being destroyed forever and ever!
\v 8 And You [are] high for all time, O YHWH.
\v 9 For behold, Your enemies, O YHWH, || For behold, Your enemies perish, || All workers of iniquity separate themselves.
\v 10 And You exalt my horn as a wild ox, || I have been anointed with fresh oil.
\v 11 And my eye looks on my enemies, || Of those rising up against me, || The evildoers, my ears hear.
\v 12 The righteous flourish as a palm-tree, || He grows as a cedar in Lebanon.
\v 13 Those planted in the house of YHWH, || In the courts of our God, flourish.
\v 14 Still they bring forth in old age, || They are fat and flourishing,
\v 15 To declare that YHWH my Rock [is] upright, || And there is no perverseness in Him!
\c 93
\p
\v 1 YHWH has reigned, || He has put on excellence, || YHWH put on strength, He girded Himself, || Also—the world is established, unmoved.
\v 2 Your throne is established since then, || You [are] from the age.
\v 3 Floods have lifted up, O YHWH, || Floods have lifted up their voice, || Floods lift up their breakers.
\v 4 Mightier than the voices of many mighty waters, breakers of a sea, || [Is] YHWH on high,
\v 5 Your testimonies have been very steadfast, || Holiness befits Your house, O YHWH, for [the] length of [Your] days!
\c 94
\p
\v 1 God of vengeance—YHWH! God of vengeance, shine forth.
\v 2 Be lifted up, judging the earth, || Send back a repayment on the proud.
\v 3 Until when do the wicked, O YHWH—Until when do the wicked exult?
\v 4 They utter—they speak arrogance, || All working iniquity boast [about] themselves.
\v 5 Your people, O YHWH, they bruise, || And they afflict Your inheritance.
\v 6 They slay widow and sojourner, || And they murder fatherless ones.
\v 7 And they say, “YAH does not see, || And the God of Jacob does not consider.”
\v 8 Consider, you brutish among the people, || And you foolish, when do you act wisely?
\v 9 He who plants the ear, does He not hear? He who forms the eye, does He not see?
\v 10 He who is instructing nations, does He not reprove? He who is teaching man knowledge [is] YHWH.
\v 11 He knows the thoughts of man, that they [are] vanity.
\v 12 O the blessedness of the man || Whom You instruct, O YAH, || And teach him out of Your law,
\v 13 To give rest to him from days of evil, || While a pit is dug for the wicked.
\v 14 For YHWH does not leave His people, || And does not forsake His inheritance.
\v 15 For judgment turns back to righteousness, || And after it all the upright of heart.
\v 16 Who rises up for me with evildoers? Who stations himself for me with workers of iniquity?
\v 17 Unless YHWH [were] a help to me, || My soul had almost inhabited silence.
\v 18 If I have said, “My foot has slipped,” || Your kindness, O YHWH, supports me.
\v 19 In the abundance of my thoughts within me, || Your comforts delight my soul.
\v 20 Is a throne of mischief joined [with] You? A framer of perverseness by statute?
\v 21 They decree against the soul of the righteous, || And declare innocent blood wicked.
\v 22 And YHWH is for a high place to me, || And my God [is] for a rock—my refuge,
\v 23 And He turns back their iniquity on them, || And in their wickedness cuts them off; Our God YHWH cuts them off!
\c 95
\p
\v 1 Come, we sing to YHWH, || We shout to the rock of our salvation.
\v 2 We come before His face with thanksgiving, || We shout to Him with psalms.
\v 3 For YHWH [is] a great God, || And a great King over all gods.
\v 4 In whose hand [are] the deep places of earth, || And the strong places of hills [are] His.
\v 5 Whose is the sea, and He made it, || And His hands formed the dry land.
\v 6 Come in, we bow ourselves, and we bend, || We kneel before YHWH our Maker.
\v 7 For He [is] our God, and we the people of His pasture, || And the flock of His hand, || Today, if you listen to His voice,
\v 8 Do not harden your heart as [in] Meribah, || As [in] the day of Massah in the wilderness,
\v 9 Where your fathers have tried Me, || Have proved Me, indeed, have seen My work.
\v 10 Forty years I am weary of the generation, || And I say, “A people erring in heart—they! And they have not known My ways”:
\v 11 Where I swore in My anger, “If they come into My rest—!”

\p
\v 1 Sing to YHWH a new song, || Sing to YHWH all the earth.
\v 2 Sing to YHWH, bless His Name, || Proclaim His salvation from day to day.
\v 3 Declare His glory among nations, || His wonders among all the peoples.
\v 4 For YHWH [is] great, and greatly praised, || He [is] fearful over all gods.
\v 5 For all the gods of the peoples [are] nothing, || And YHWH made the heavens.
\v 6 Splendor and majesty [are] before Him, || Strength and beauty in His sanctuary.
\v 7 Ascribe to YHWH, O families of the peoples, || Ascribe to YHWH glory and strength.
\v 8 Ascribe to YHWH the glory of His Name, || Lift up a present and come into His courts.
\v 9 Bow yourselves to YHWH, || In the honor of holiness, || Be afraid of His presence, all the earth.
\v 10 Say among nations, “YHWH has reigned, || Also—the world is established, unmoved, || He judges the peoples in uprightness.”
\v 11 The heavens rejoice, and the earth is joyful, || The sea and its fullness roar.
\v 12 The field exults, and all that [is] in it, || Then all trees of the forest sing,
\v 13 Before YHWH, for He has come, || For He has come to judge the earth. He judges the world in righteousness, || And the peoples in His faithfulness!
\c 97
\p
\v 1 YHWH has reigned, || The earth is joyful, many islands rejoice.
\v 2 Cloud and darkness [are] around Him, || Righteousness and judgment the basis of His throne.
\v 3 Fire goes before Him, || And burns around His adversaries.
\v 4 His lightnings have lightened the world, || The earth has seen, and is pained.
\v 5 Hills, like wax, melted before YHWH, || Before the Lord of all the earth.
\v 6 The heavens declared His righteousness, || And all the peoples have seen His glory.
\v 7 All servants of a carved image are ashamed, || Those boasting themselves in idols, || Bow yourselves to Him, all you gods.
\v 8 Zion has heard and rejoices, || And daughters of Judah are joyful, || Because of Your judgments, O YHWH.
\v 9 For You, YHWH, [are] Most High over all the earth, || You have been exalted greatly over all gods.
\v 10 You who love YHWH, hate evil, || He is keeping the souls of His saints, || He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
\v 11 Light [is] sown for the righteous, || And joy for the upright of heart.
\v 12 Rejoice, you righteous, in YHWH, || And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness!
\c 98
\p
\v 1 A PSALM. Sing to YHWH a new song, || For He has done wonders, || His right hand and His holy arm have given salvation to Him.
\v 2 YHWH has made His salvation known, || Before the eyes of the nations, || He has revealed His righteousness,
\v 3 He has remembered His kindness, || And His faithfulness to the house of Israel, || All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
\v 4 Shout to YHWH, all the earth, || Break forth, and cry aloud, and sing.
\v 5 Sing to YHWH with harp, || With harp, and voice of praise,
\v 6 With trumpets, and voice of a horn, shout before the King, YHWH.
\v 7 The sea and its fullness roar, || The world and the inhabitants in it.
\v 8 Floods clap hand, together hills cry aloud,
\v 9 Before YHWH, || For He has come to judge the earth, || He judges the world in righteousness, || And the people in uprightness!
\c 99

\v 1 YHWH has reigned, peoples tremble, || The Inhabitant of the cherubim, the earth shakes.
\v 2 YHWH [is] great in Zion, || And He [is] high over all the peoples.
\v 3 They praise Your Name, “Great, and fearful, [it] is holy!”
\v 4 And the strength of the king || Has loved judgment, || You have established uprightness; Judgment and righteousness in Jacob, || You have done.
\v 5 Exalt our God YHWH, || And bow yourselves at His footstool, He [is] holy.
\v 6 Moses and Aaron among His priests, || And Samuel among those proclaiming His Name. They are calling to YHWH, || And He answers them.
\v 7 He speaks to them in a pillar of cloud, || They have kept His testimonies, || And He has given the statute to them.
\v 8 O YHWH, our God, || You have afflicted them, || You have been a forgiving God to them, || And taking vengeance on their actions.
\v 9 Exalt our God YHWH, || And bow yourselves at His holy hill, || For our God YHWH [is] holy!

\v 1 A PSALM OF THANKSGIVING. Shout to YHWH, all the earth!
\v 2 Serve YHWH with joy, come before Him with singing.
\v 3 Know that YHWH [is] God, || He made us, and we are His, || His people—and the flock of His pasture.
\v 4 Enter His gates with thanksgiving, || His courts with praise, || Give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
\v 5 For YHWH [is] good, || His kindness [is] for all time, || And His faithfulness to generation and generation!
\c 101
\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF DAVID. I sing kindness and judgment, || To You, O YHWH, I sing praise.
\v 2 I act wisely in a perfect way, || When do You come to me? I habitually walk in the integrity of my heart, || In the midst of my house.
\v 3 I do not set a worthless thing before my eyes, || I have hated the work of those turning aside, || It does not adhere to me.
\v 4 A perverse heart turns aside from me, || I do not know wickedness.
\v 5 Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, || Him I cut off, || The high of eyes and proud of heart, || Him I do not endure.
\v 6 My eyes are on the faithful of the land, || To dwell with me, || Whoever is walking in a perfect way, he serves me.
\v 7 He who is working deceit does not dwell in my house, || Whoever is speaking lies is not established before my eyes.
\v 8 At morning I cut off all the wicked of the land, || To cut off from the city of YHWH || All the workers of iniquity!
\c 102
\p
\v 1 A PRAYER OF THE AFFLICTED WHEN HE IS FEEBLE, AND POURS OUT HIS COMPLAINT BEFORE YHWH. O YHWH, hear my prayer, indeed, my cry comes to You.
\v 2 Do not hide Your face from me, || In a day of my adversity, || Incline Your ear to me, || In the day I call, hurry, answer me.
\v 3 For my days have been consumed in smoke, || And my bones have burned as a firebrand.
\v 4 Struck as the herb, and withered, is my heart, || For I have forgotten to eat my bread.
\v 5 From the voice of my sighing || My bone has cleaved to my flesh.
\v 6 I have been like to a pelican of the wilderness, || I have been as an owl of the dry places.
\v 7 I have watched, and I am || As a bird alone on the roof.
\v 8 All the day my enemies reproached me, || Those mad at me have sworn against me.
\v 9 Because I have eaten ashes as bread, || And have mingled my drink with weeping,
\v 10 From Your indignation and Your wrath, || For You have lifted me up, || And cast me down.
\v 11 My days [are] stretched out as a shadow, || And I am withered as the herb.
\v 12 And You, O YHWH, abide for all time, || And Your memorial from generation to generation.
\v 13 You rise—You pity Zion, || For the time to favor her, || For the appointed time has come.
\v 14 For Your servants have been pleased with her stones, || And they favor her dust.
\v 15 And nations fear the Name of YHWH, || And all kings of the earth Your glory,
\v 16 For YHWH has built Zion, || He has been seen in His glory,
\v 17 He turned to the prayer of the destitute, || And He has not despised their prayer.
\v 18 This is written for a later generation, || And the people created praise YAH.
\v 19 For He has looked || From the high place of His sanctuary. YHWH looked attentively from the heavens to earth,
\v 20 To hear the groan of the prisoner, || To loose sons of death,
\v 21 To declare in Zion the Name of YHWH, || And His praise in Jerusalem,
\v 22 In the peoples being gathered together, || And the kingdoms—to serve YHWH.
\v 23 He has humbled my power in the way, || He has shortened my days.
\v 24 I say, “My God, do not take me up in the midst of my days,” || Your years [are] through all generations.
\v 25 You founded the earth before time, || And the heavens [are] the work of Your hands.
\v 26 They perish, and You remain, || And all of them become old as a garment, || You change them as clothing, || And they are changed.
\v 27 And You [are] the same, and Your years are not finished.
\v 28 The sons of Your servants continue, || And their seed is established before You!
\c 103
\p
\v 1 BY DAVID. Bless, O my soul, YHWH, || And all my inward parts—His Holy Name.
\v 2 Bless, O my soul, YHWH, || And do not forget all His benefits,
\v 3 Who is forgiving all your iniquities, || Who is healing all your diseases,
\v 4 Who is redeeming your life from destruction, || Who is crowning you [with] kindness and mercies,
\v 5 Who is satisfying your desire with good, || Your youth renews itself as an eagle.
\v 6 YHWH is doing righteousness and judgments || For all the oppressed.
\v 7 He makes His ways known to Moses, || His acts to the sons of Israel.
\v 8 YHWH [is] merciful and gracious, || Slow to anger, and abundant in mercy.
\v 9 He does not strive forever, || Nor does He watch for all time.
\v 10 He has not done to us according to our sins, || Nor according to our iniquities || Has He conferred benefits on us.
\v 11 For as the height of the heavens [is] above the earth, || His kindness has been mighty over those fearing Him.
\v 12 He has put our transgressions far from us—as the distance of east from west.
\v 13 As a father has mercy on sons, || YHWH has mercy on those fearing Him.
\v 14 For He has known our frame, || Remembering that we [are] dust.
\v 15 Mortal man! His days [are] as grass, || He flourishes as a flower of the field;
\v 16 For a wind has passed over it, and it is not, || And its place does not discern it anymore.
\v 17 And the kindness of YHWH || [Is] from age even to age on those fearing Him, || And His righteousness to sons’ sons,
\v 18 To those keeping His covenant, || And to those remembering His precepts to do them.
\v 19 YHWH has established His throne in the heavens, || And His kingdom has ruled over all.
\v 20 Bless YHWH, you His messengers, || Mighty in power—doing His word, || To listen to the voice of His word.
\v 21 Bless YHWH, all you His hosts, || His ministers—doing His pleasure.
\v 22 Bless YHWH, all you His works, || In all places of His dominion. Bless, O my soul, YHWH!
\c 104
\p
\v 1 Bless, O my soul, YHWH! YHWH, my God, || You have been very great, || You have put on splendor and majesty.
\v 2 Covering Himself [with] light as a garment, || Stretching out the heavens as a curtain,
\v 3 Who is laying the beam of His upper chambers in the waters, || Who is making thick clouds His chariot, || Who is walking on wings of wind,
\v 4 Making His messengers—the winds, || His ministers—the flaming fire.
\v 5 He has founded earth on its bases, || It is not moved for all time and forever.
\v 6 The abyss! You have covered it as with clothing, || Waters stand above hills.
\v 7 They flee from Your rebuke, || They hurry away from the voice of Your thunder.
\v 8 They go up hills—they go down valleys, || To a place You have founded for them.
\v 9 You have set a border, they do not pass over, || They do not turn back to cover the earth.
\v 10 He is sending forth fountains in valleys, || They go on between hills.
\v 11 They water every beast of the field, || Wild donkeys break their thirst.
\v 12 The bird of the heavens dwells by them, || From between the branches || They give forth the voice.
\v 13 Watering hills from His upper chambers, || The earth is satisfied from the fruit of Your works.
\v 14 Causing grass to spring up for livestock, || And herb for the service of man, || To bring forth bread from the earth,
\v 15 And wine—it makes the heart of man glad, || To cause the face to shine from oil, || And bread—it supports the heart of man.
\v 16 The trees of YHWH [are] satisfied, || Cedars of Lebanon that He has planted,
\v 17 Where birds make nests, || The stork—the firs [are] her house.
\v 18 The high hills [are] for wild goats, rocks [are] a refuge for hyraxes,
\v 19 He made the moon for seasons, || The sun has known his place of entrance.
\v 20 You set darkness, and it is night, || Every beast of the forest creeps in it.
\v 21 The young lions are roaring for prey, || And to seek their food from God.
\v 22 The sun rises, they are gathered, || And they crouch in their dens.
\v 23 Man goes forth to his work, || And to his service—until evening.
\v 24 How many have been Your works, O YHWH, || You have made all of them in wisdom, || The earth is full of your possessions.
\v 25 This, the sea, great and broad of sides, || There [are] moving things—innumerable, || Living creatures—small with great.
\v 26 There ships go—[and] leviathan, || That You have formed to play in it.
\v 27 All of them look to You, || To give their food in its season.
\v 28 You give to them—they gather, || You open Your hand—they [are] satisfied [with] good.
\v 29 You hide Your face—they are troubled, || You gather their spirit—they expire, || And they return to their dust.
\v 30 You send out Your Spirit, they are created, || And You renew the face of the ground.
\v 31 The glory of YHWH is for all time, || YHWH rejoices in His works,
\v 32 Who is looking to earth, and it trembles, || He comes against hills, and they smoke.
\v 33 I sing to YHWH during my life, || I sing praise to my God while I exist.
\v 34 My meditation on Him is sweet, || I rejoice in YHWH.
\v 35 Sinners are consumed from the earth, || And the wicked are no more. Bless, O my soul, YHWH. Praise YAH!
\c 105
\p
\v 1 Give thanks to YHWH—call on His Name, || Make His acts known among the peoples.
\v 2 Sing to Him—sing praise to Him, || Meditate on all His wonders.
\v 3 Boast yourselves in His Holy Name, || The heart of those seeking YHWH rejoices.
\v 4 Seek YHWH and His strength, || Seek His face continually.
\v 5 Remember His wonders that He did, || His signs and the judgments of His mouth.
\v 6 O seed of Abraham, His servant, || O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
\v 7 He [is] our God YHWH, || His judgments [are] in all the earth.
\v 8 He has remembered His covenant for all time, || The word He commanded to one thousand generations,
\v 9 That He has made with Abraham, || And His oath to Isaac,
\v 10 And establishes it to Jacob for a statute, || To Israel—a perpetual covenant,
\v 11 Saying, “I give the land of Canaan to you, || The portion of your inheritance,”
\v 12 In their being few in number, || But a few, and sojourners in it.
\v 13 And they go up and down, from nation to nation, || From a kingdom to another people.
\v 14 He has not permitted any to oppress them || And He reproves kings for their sakes.
\v 15 “Do not strike against My anointed, || And do no evil to My prophets.”
\v 16 And He calls a famine on the land, || He has broken the whole staff of bread.
\v 17 He has sent a man before them, || Joseph has been sold for a servant.
\v 18 They have afflicted his feet with chains, || Iron has entered his soul,
\v 19 Until the time of the coming of His word || The saying of YHWH has tried him.
\v 20 The king has sent, and looses him, || The ruler of the peoples, and draws him out.
\v 21 He has made him lord of his house, || And ruler over all his possessions.
\v 22 To bind his chiefs at his pleasure, || And he makes his elderly wise.
\v 23 And Israel comes into Egypt, || And Jacob has sojourned in the land of Ham.
\v 24 And He makes His people very fruitful, || And makes it mightier than its adversaries.
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate His people, || To conspire against His servants.
\v 26 He has sent His servant Moses, || Aaron whom He had fixed on.
\v 27 They have set among them the matters of His signs, || And wonders in the land of Ham.
\v 28 He has sent darkness, and it is dark, || And they have not provoked His word.
\v 29 He has turned their waters to blood, || And puts their fish to death.
\v 30 Their land has teemed [with] frogs, || In the inner chambers of their kings.
\v 31 He has commanded, and the beetle comes, || Lice into all their border.
\v 32 He has made their showers hail, || A flaming fire [is] in their land.
\v 33 And He strikes their vine and their fig, || And shatters the trees of their border.
\v 34 He has commanded, and the locust comes, || And the cankerworm—innumerable,
\v 35 And it consumes every herb in their land, || And it consumes the fruit of their ground.
\v 36 And He strikes every firstborn in their land, || The first-fruit of all their strength,
\v 37 And brings them out with silver and gold, || And there is not a feeble one in its tribes.
\v 38 Egypt has rejoiced in their going forth, || For their fear had fallen on them.
\v 39 He has spread a cloud for a covering, || And fire to enlighten the night.
\v 40 They have asked, and He brings quails, || And satisfies them [with] bread of the heavens.
\v 41 He has opened a rock, and waters flow, || They have gone on in dry places—a river.
\v 42 For He has remembered His holy word, || With His servant Abraham,
\v 43 And He brings forth His people with joy, || His chosen ones with singing.
\v 44 And He gives to them the lands of nations, || And they possess the labor of peoples,
\v 45 That they may observe His statutes, || And may keep His laws. Praise YAH!
\c 106
\p
\v 1 Praise YAH, give thanks to YHWH, for [He is] good, for His kindness [is] for all time!
\v 2 Who utters the mighty acts of YHWH? Sounds all His praise?
\v 3 O the blessedness of those keeping judgment, || Doing righteousness at all times.
\v 4 Remember me, O YHWH, || With the favor of Your people, || Look after me in Your salvation.
\v 5 To look on the good of Your chosen ones, || To rejoice in the joy of Your nation, || To boast myself with Your inheritance.
\v 6 We have sinned with our fathers, || We have done perversely, we have done wickedly.
\v 7 Our fathers in Egypt, || Have not considered wisely Your wonders, || They have not remembered || The abundance of Your kind acts, || And provoke by the sea, at the Sea of Suph.
\v 8 And He saves them for His Name’s sake, || To make His might known,
\v 9 And rebukes the Sea of Suph, and it is dried up, || And causes them to go || Through depths as a wilderness.
\v 10 And He saves them from the hand || Of him who is hating, || And redeems them from the hand of the enemy.
\v 11 And waters cover their adversaries, || One of them has not been left.
\v 12 And they believe in His words, they sing His praise,
\v 13 They have hurried—forgotten His works, || They have not waited for His counsel.
\v 14 And they lust greatly in a wilderness, || And try God in a desert.
\v 15 And He gives to them their request, || And sends leanness into their soul.
\v 16 And they are envious of Moses in the camp, || Of Aaron, YHWH’s holy one.
\v 17 Earth opens, and swallows up Dathan, || And covers over the company of Abiram.
\v 18 And fire burns among their company, || A flame sets the wicked on fire.
\v 19 They make a calf in Horeb, || And bow themselves to a molten image,
\v 20 And change their glory || Into the form of an ox eating herbs.
\v 21 They have forgotten God their Savior, || The doer of great things in Egypt,
\v 22 Of wonderful things in the land of Ham, || Of fearful things by the Sea of Suph.
\v 23 And He commands to destroy them, || Unless Moses, His chosen one, || Had stood in the breach before Him, || To turn back His wrath from destroying.
\v 24 And they kick against the desirable land, || They have not given credence to His word.
\v 25 And they murmur in their tents, || They have not listened to the voice of YHWH.
\v 26 And He lifts up His hand to them, || To cause them to fall in a wilderness,
\v 27 And to cause their seed to fall among nations, || And to scatter them through lands.
\v 28 And they are coupled to Ba‘al-Peor, || And eat the sacrifices of the dead,
\v 29 And they provoke to anger by their actions, || And a plague breaks forth on them,
\v 30 And Phinehas stands, and executes judgment, || And the plague is restrained,
\v 31 And it is reckoned to him for righteousness, || From generation to generation—for all time.
\v 32 And they cause wrath by the waters of Meribah, || And it is evil to Moses for their sakes,
\v 33 For they have provoked his spirit, || And he speaks wrongfully with his lips.
\v 34 They have not destroyed the peoples, || As YHWH had commanded to them,
\v 35 And mix themselves among nations, and learn their works,
\v 36 And serve their idols, || And they are for a snare to them.
\v 37 And they sacrifice their sons and their daughters to the demons,
\v 38 And they shed innocent blood—Blood of their sons and of their daughters, || Whom they have sacrificed to idols of Canaan, || And the land is profaned with blood.
\v 39 And they are defiled with their works, || And commit whoredom in their habitual doings.
\v 40 And the anger of YHWH || Is kindled against His people, || And He detests His inheritance.
\v 41 And gives them into the hand of nations, || And those hating them rule over them,
\v 42 And their enemies oppress them, || And they are humbled under their hand.
\v 43 He delivers them many times, || And they rebel in their counsel, || And they are brought low in their iniquity.
\v 44 And He looks on their distress || When He hears their cry,
\v 45 And remembers His covenant for them, || And is comforted, || According to the abundance of His kindness.
\v 46 And He appoints them for mercies || Before all their captors.
\v 47 Save us, O our God YHWH, and gather us from the nations, || To give thanks to Your Holy Name, || To glory in Your praise.
\v 48 Blessed [is] YHWH, God of Israel, || From age until age. And all the people said, “Amen, praise YAH!”
\c 107
\p
\v 1 “Give thanks to YHWH, || For [He is] good, for His kindness [is] for all time”:
\v 2 Let the redeemed of YHWH say [so], || Whom He redeemed from the hand of an adversary.
\v 3 And has gathered them from the lands, || From east and from west, || From north, and from the sea.
\v 4 They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert by the way, || They have not found a city of habitation.
\v 5 Hungry—indeed—thirsty, || Their soul becomes feeble in them,
\v 6 And they cry to YHWH in their adversity, || He delivers them from their distress,
\v 7 And causes them to tread in a right way, || To go to a city of habitation.
\v 8 They confess to YHWH His kindness, || And His wonders to the sons of men.
\v 9 For He has satisfied a longing soul, || And has filled a hungry soul [with] goodness.
\v 10 Inhabitants of dark places and death-shade, || Prisoners of affliction and of iron,
\v 11 Because they changed the saying of God, || And despised the counsel of the Most High.
\v 12 And He humbles their heart with labor, || They have been feeble, and there is no helper.
\v 13 And they cry to YHWH in their adversity, || He saves them from their distresses.
\v 14 He brings them out from the dark place, || And death-shade, || And He draws away their bands.
\v 15 They confess to YHWH His kindness, || And His wonders to the sons of men.
\v 16 For He has broken doors of bronze, || And He has cut bars of iron.
\v 17 Fools, by means of their transgression, || And by their iniquities, afflict themselves.
\v 18 Their soul detests all food, || And they come near to the gates of death,
\v 19 And cry to YHWH in their adversity, || He saves them from their distresses,
\v 20 He sends His word and heals them, || And delivers [them] from their destructions.
\v 21 They confess to YHWH His kindness, || And His wonders to the sons of men,
\v 22 And they sacrifice sacrifices of thanksgiving, || And recount His works with singing.
\v 23 Those going down [to] the sea in ships, || Doing business in many waters,
\v 24 They have seen the works of YHWH, || And His wonders in the deep.
\v 25 And He commands, and appoints a storm, || And it lifts up its billows,
\v 26 They go up [to] the heavens, they go down [to] the depths, || Their soul is melted in evil.
\v 27 They reel to and fro, and move as a drunkard, || And all their wisdom is swallowed up.
\v 28 And they cry to YHWH in their adversity, || And He brings them out from their distresses.
\v 29 He calms a whirlwind, || And their billows are hushed.
\v 30 And they rejoice because they are quiet, || And He leads them to the haven of their desire.
\v 31 They confess to YHWH His kindness, || And His wonders to the sons of men,
\v 32 And they exalt Him in [the] assembly of [the] people, || And praise Him in [the] seat of [the] elderly.
\v 33 He makes rivers become a wilderness, || And fountains of waters become dry land.
\v 34 A fruitful land becomes a barren place, || For the wickedness of its inhabitants.
\v 35 He makes a wilderness become a pool of water, || And a dry land become fountains of waters.
\v 36 And He causes the hungry to dwell there, || And they prepare a city of habitation.
\v 37 And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, || And they make fruits of increase.
\v 38 And He blesses them, and they multiply exceedingly, || And He does not diminish their livestock.
\v 39 And they are diminished, and bow down, || By restraint, evil, and sorrow.
\v 40 He is pouring contempt on nobles, || And causes them to wander in vacancy—no way.
\v 41 And sets the needy on high from affliction, || And places families as a flock.
\v 42 The upright see and rejoice, || And all perversity has shut her mouth.
\v 43 Who [is] wise, and observes these? They understand the kind acts of YHWH!
\c 108

\v 1 A SONG. A PSALM OF DAVID. My heart is prepared, O God, || I sing, indeed, I sing praise, also my glory.
\v 2 Awake, stringed instrument and harp, || I awake the dawn.
\v 3 I thank You among peoples, O YHWH, || And I praise You among the nations.
\v 4 For Your kindness [is] great above the heavens, || And Your truth to the clouds.
\v 5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God, || And Your glory above all the earth.
\v 6 That Your beloved ones may be delivered, || Save [with] Your right hand, and answer us.
\v 7 God has spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, || And I measure the Valley of Succoth,
\v 8 Gilead [is] Mine, Manasseh [is] Mine, || And Ephraim [is] the strength of My head, || Judah [is] My lawgiver,
\v 9 Moab [is] a pot for My washing, || On Edom I cast My shoe, || Over Philistia I habitually shout.
\v 10 Who brings me [into] the fortified city? Who has led me to Edom?
\v 11 Have You not, O God, cast us off? And You do not go out, O God, with our hosts!
\v 12 Give to us help from adversity, || And the salvation of man is vain.
\v 13 We do mightily in God, || And He treads down our adversaries!
\c 109
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. O God of my praise, do not be silent,
\v 2 For the mouth of wickedness, and the mouth of deceit, || They have opened against me, || They have spoken with me—A tongue of falsehood, and words of hatred!
\v 3 They have surrounded me about, || And they fight me without cause.
\v 4 For my love they oppose me, and I—prayer!
\v 5 And they set against me evil for good, || And hatred for my love.
\v 6 Appoint the wicked over him, || And an adversary stands at his right hand.
\v 7 In his being judged, he goes forth wicked, || And his prayer is for sin.
\v 8 His days are few, another takes his oversight,
\v 9 His sons are fatherless, and his wife a widow.
\v 10 And his sons wander continually, || Indeed, they have begged, || And have sought out of their dry places.
\v 11 An exactor lays a snare for all that he has, || And strangers spoil his labor.
\v 12 He has none to extend kindness, || Nor is there one showing favor to his orphans.
\v 13 His posterity is for cutting off, || Their name is blotted out in another generation.
\v 14 The iniquity of his fathers || Is remembered to YHWH, || And the sin of his mother is not blotted out.
\v 15 They are continually before YHWH, || And He cuts off their memorial from earth.
\v 16 Because that he has not remembered to do kindness, || And pursues the poor man and needy, || And the struck of heart—to slay,
\v 17 And he loves reviling, and it meets him, || And he has not delighted in blessing, || And it is far from him.
\v 18 And he puts on reviling as his robe, || And it comes in as water into his midst, || And as oil into his bones.
\v 19 It is to him as apparel—he covers himself, || And he girds it on for a continual girdle.
\v 20 This [is] the wage of my accusers from YHWH, || And of those speaking evil against my soul.
\v 21 And You, O Lord YHWH, || Deal with me for Your Name’s sake, || Because Your kindness [is] good, deliver me.
\v 22 For I [am] poor and needy, || And my heart has been pierced in my midst.
\v 23 I have gone as a shadow when it is stretched out, || I have been driven away as a locust.
\v 24 My knees have been feeble from fasting, || And my flesh has failed of fatness.
\v 25 And I have been a reproach to them, || They see me, they shake their head.
\v 26 Help me, O YHWH my God, || Save me, according to Your kindness.
\v 27 And they know that this [is] Your hand, || You, O YHWH, You have done it.
\v 28 They revile, and You bless, || They have risen, and are ashamed, || And Your servant rejoices.
\v 29 My accusers put on blushing, and are covered, || Their shame [is] as an upper robe.
\v 30 I thank YHWH greatly with my mouth, || And I praise Him in the midst of many,
\v 31 For He stands at the right hand of the needy, || To save from those judging his soul.

\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF DAVID. A declaration of YHWH to my Lord: “Sit at My right hand, || Until I make Your enemies Your footstool.”
\v 2 YHWH sends the rod of Your strength from Zion, || Rule in the midst of Your enemies.
\v 3 Your people [are] free-will gifts in the day of Your strength, in the honors of holiness, || From the womb, from the morning, || You have the dew of Your youth.
\v 4 YHWH has sworn, and does not relent, “You [are] a priest for all time, || According to the order of Melchizedek.”
\v 5 The Lord on Your right hand struck kings || In the day of His anger.
\v 6 He judges among the nations, || He has completed the carcasses, || Has struck the head over the mighty earth.
\v 7 He drinks from a brook in the way, || Therefore He lifts up the head!
\c 111
\p
\v 1 Praise YAH! [ALEPH-BET] I thank YHWH with the whole heart, || In the secret meeting of the upright, || And of the congregation.
\v 2 Great [are] the works of YHWH, || Sought out by all desiring them.
\v 3 Splendid and majestic is His work, || And His righteousness is standing forever.
\v 4 He has made a memorial of His wonders, || YHWH [is] gracious and merciful.
\v 5 He has given prey to those fearing Him, || He remembers His covenant for all time.
\v 6 He has declared the power of His works to His people, || To give to them the inheritance of nations.
\v 7 The works of His hands [are] true and just, || All His appointments [are] steadfast.
\v 8 They are sustained forever and for all time. They are made in truth and uprightness.
\v 9 He has sent redemption to His people, || He has appointed His covenant for all time, || His Name [is] holy and fearful.
\v 10 The fear of YHWH [is] the beginning of wisdom, || Good understanding have all doing them, || His praise [is] standing forever!

\v 1 Praise YAH! [ALEPH-BET] O the blessedness of one fearing YHWH, || He has greatly delighted in His commands.
\v 2 His seed is mighty in the earth, || The generation of the upright is blessed.
\v 3 Wealth and riches [are] in his house, || And his righteousness is standing forever.
\v 4 Light has risen in darkness to the upright, || Gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
\v 5 The man—good, gracious, and lending, || He sustains his matters in judgment.
\v 6 For he is not moved for all time; For the righteous is a continuous memorial.
\v 7 He is not afraid of an evil report, || His heart is prepared [and] confident in YHWH.
\v 8 His heart is sustained—he does not fear, || Until he looks on his adversaries.
\v 9 He has scattered—has given to the needy, || His righteousness is standing forever, || His horn is exalted with glory.
\v 10 The wicked sees, and has been angry, || He gnashes his teeth, and has melted, || The desire of the wicked perishes!

\v 3 From the rising of the sun to its going in, || The Name of YHWH [is] praised.
\v 4 YHWH [is] high above all nations, || His glory [is] above the heavens.
\v 5 Who [is] as our God YHWH, || He is exalting [Himself] to sit?
\v 6 He is humbling [Himself] to look || On the heavens and on the earth.
\v 7 He is raising up the poor from the dust, || He exalts the needy from a dunghill.
\v 8 To cause [them] to sit with princes, || With the princes of His people.
\v 9 Causing the barren one of the house to sit, || A joyful mother of sons; praise YAH!

\v 1 In the going out of Israel from Egypt, || The house of Jacob from a strange people,
\v 2 Judah became His sanctuary, || Israel his dominion.
\v 3 The sea has seen, and flees, || The Jordan turns backward.
\v 4 The mountains have skipped as rams, || Heights as sons of a flock.
\v 5 What is [ailing] you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, you turn back!
\v 6 O mountains, you skip as rams! O heights, as sons of a flock!
\v 7 From before the Lord be afraid, O earth, || From before the God of Jacob,
\v 8 He is turning the rock to a pool of waters, || The flint to a fountain of waters!

\v 1 Not to us, O YHWH, not to us, || But to Your Name give glory, || For Your kindness, for Your truth.
\v 2 Why do the nations say, “Where, pray, [is] their God?”
\v 3 And our God [is] in the heavens, || All that He has pleased He has done.
\v 4 Their idols [are] silver and gold, work of man’s hands,
\v 5 They have a mouth, and they do not speak, || They have eyes, and they do not see,
\v 6 They have ears, and they do not hear, || They have a nose, and they do not smell,
\v 7 Their hands, but they do not handle, || Their feet, and they do not walk;
\v 8 Nor do they mutter through their throat, || Their makers are like them, || Everyone who is trusting in them.
\v 9 O Israel, trust in YHWH, “He [is] their help and their shield.”
\v 10 O house of Aaron, trust in YHWH, “He [is] their help and their shield.”
\v 11 You fearing YHWH, trust in YHWH, “He [is] their help and their shield.”
\v 12 YHWH has remembered us, He blesses, || He blesses the house of Israel, || He blesses the house of Aaron,
\v 13 He blesses those fearing YHWH, || The small with the great.
\v 14 YHWH adds to you—to you and to your sons.
\v 15 Blessed [are] you of YHWH, || Maker of the heavens and earth,
\v 16 The heavens—the heavens [are] YHWH’s, || And He has given the earth to sons of men;
\v 17 The dead do not praise YAH, || Nor any going down to silence.
\v 18 And we, we bless YAH, || From now on, and for all time. Praise YAH!

\v 1 I have loved, because YHWH hears My voice, my supplication,
\v 2 Because He has inclined His ear to me, || And during my days I call.
\v 3 Cords of death have surrounded me, || And straits of Sheol have found me, || I find distress and sorrow.
\v 4 And in the Name of YHWH I call: Ah, now, O YHWH, deliver my soul,
\v 5 YHWH [is] gracious, and righteous, || Indeed, our God [is] merciful,
\v 6 YHWH [is] a preserver of the simple, || I was low, and He gives salvation to me.
\v 7 Return, O my soul, to your rest, || For YHWH has conferred benefits on you.
\v 8 For You have delivered my soul from death, || My eyes from tears, my feet from overthrowing.
\v 9 I habitually walk before YHWH || In the lands of the living.
\v 10 I have believed, for I speak, || I have been greatly afflicted.
\v 11 I said in my haste, “Every man [is] a liar.”
\v 12 What do I return to YHWH? All His benefits [are] on me.
\v 13 I lift up the cup of salvation, || And in the Name of YHWH I call.
\v 14 Let me complete my vows to YHWH, || Now, before all His people.
\v 15 Precious in the eyes of YHWH [is] the death of His saints.
\v 16 Ah, now, O YHWH, for I [am] Your servant; I [am] Your servant, son of Your handmaid; You have opened my bonds.
\v 17 I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks to You, || And in the Name of YHWH I call.
\v 18 Let me complete my vows to YHWH, || Now, before all His people,
\v 19 In the courts of the house of YHWH, || In your midst, O Jerusalem, praise YAH!
\c 117

\v 1 Praise YHWH, all you nations, || Glorify Him, all you peoples!

\v 1 Give thanks to YHWH, || For [He is] good, for His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 2 Now let Israel say, || His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 3 Now let the house of Aaron say, || His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 4 Now let those fearing YHWH say, || His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 5 I called YAH from the narrow place, || YAH answered me in a broad place.
\v 6 YHWH [is] for me, || I do not fear what man does to me.
\v 7 YHWH [is] for me among my helpers, || And I look on those hating me.
\v 8 Better to take refuge in YHWH, || Than to trust in man,
\v 9 Better to take refuge in YHWH, || Than to trust in princes.
\v 10 All nations have surrounded me, || In the Name of YHWH I surely cut them off.
\v 11 They have surrounded me, || Indeed, they have surrounded me, || In the Name of YHWH I surely cut them off.
\v 12 They surrounded me as bees, || They have been extinguished as a fire of thorns, || In the Name of YHWH I surely cut them off.
\v 13 You have severely thrust me to fall, || And YHWH has helped me.
\v 14 YAH is my strength and song, || And He is to me for salvation.
\v 15 A voice of singing and salvation, || [Is] in the tents of the righteous, || The right hand of YHWH is doing valiantly.
\v 16 The right hand of YHWH is exalted, || The right hand of YHWH is doing valiantly.
\v 17 I do not die, but live, || And recount the works of YAH,
\v 18 YAH has severely disciplined me, || And has not given me up to death.
\v 19 Open gates of righteousness to me, || I enter into them—I thank YAH.
\v 20 This [is] the gate to YHWH, || The righteous enter into it.
\v 21 I thank You, for You have answered me, || And are to me for salvation.
\v 22 A stone the builders refused || Has become head of a corner.
\v 23 This has been from YHWH, || It [is] wonderful in our eyes,
\v 24 This [is] the day YHWH has made, || We rejoice and are glad in it.
\v 25 Ah, now, O YHWH, please save, || Ah, now, O YHWH, please prosper.
\v 26 Blessed [is] He who is coming || In the Name of YHWH, || We blessed you from the house of YHWH,
\v 27 God [is] YHWH, and He gives light to us, || Direct the festal-sacrifice with cords, || To the horns of the altar.
\v 28 You [are] my God, and I confess You, || My God, I exalt You.

\v 1 A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. BY DAVID. If YHWH had not been for us || (Pray, let Israel say),
\v 2 If YHWH had not been for us, || In the rising up of man against us,
\v 3 Then they had swallowed us alive, || In the burning of their anger against us,
\v 4 Then the waters had overflowed us, || The stream passed over our soul,
\v 5 Then proud waters had passed over our soul.
\v 6 Blessed [is] YHWH who has not given us, || [As] prey to their teeth.
\v 7 Our soul has escaped as a bird from a snare of fowlers, || The snare was broken, and we have escaped.
\v 8 Our help [is] in the Name of YHWH, || Maker of the heavens and earth!
\c 125
\p
\v 1 A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. Those trusting in YHWH [are] as Mount Zion, || It is not moved—it abides for all time.
\v 2 Jerusalem! Mountains [are] around her, || And YHWH [is] around His people, || From now on—even for all time.
\v 3 For the rod of wickedness does not rest on the lot of the righteous, || That the righteous do not put forth their hands on iniquity.
\v 4 Do good, O YHWH, to the good, || And to the upright in their hearts.
\v 5 As for those turning [to] their crooked ways, || YHWH causes them to go with workers of iniquity. Peace on Israel!
\c 126
\p
\v 1 A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. In YHWH’s turning back [to] the captivity of Zion, || We have been as dreamers.
\v 2 Then our mouth is filled [with] laughter, || And our tongue [with] singing, || Then they say among nations, “YHWH did great things with these.”
\v 3 YHWH did great things with us, || We have been joyful.
\v 4 Turn again, O YHWH, [to] our captivity, || As streams in the south.
\v 5 Those sowing in tears, reap with singing,
\v 6 Whoever goes on and weeps, || Carrying the basket of seed, || Surely comes in with singing, carrying his sheaves!
\c 127
\p
\v 1 A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. BY SOLOMON. If YHWH does not build the house, || Its builders have labored at it in vain, || If YHWH does not watch a city, || A watchman has awoken in vain.
\v 2 Vain for you who are rising early, || Who delay sitting, eating the bread of griefs, || So He gives sleep to His beloved one.
\v 3 Behold, sons [are] an inheritance of YHWH, || The fruit of the womb [is] a reward.
\v 4 As arrows in the hand of a mighty one, || So [are] the sons of the young men.
\v 5 O the blessedness of the man || Who has filled his quiver with them, || They are not ashamed, || For they speak with enemies in the gate!
\c 128
\p
\v 1 A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. O the blessedness of everyone fearing YHWH, || Who is walking in His ways.
\v 2 You surely eat the labor of your hands, || You [are] blessed, and good [is] to you.
\v 3 Your wife [is] as a fruitful vine in the sides of your house, || Your sons as olive plants around your table.
\v 4 Behold, surely thus is the man blessed who is fearing YHWH.
\v 5 YHWH blesses you out of Zion, || Look, then, on the good of Jerusalem, || All the days of your life,
\v 6 And see the sons of your sons! Peace on Israel!
\c 129
\p
\v 1 A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. Often they distressed me from my youth, || Pray, let Israel say:
\v 2 Often they distressed me from my youth, || Yet they have not prevailed over me.
\v 3 Plowers have plowed over my back, || They have made their furrows long.
\v 4 YHWH [is] righteous, || He has cut apart cords of the wicked.
\v 5 All hating Zion [are] confounded and turn backward.
\v 6 They are as grass of the roofs, || That withers before it was drawn out,
\v 7 That has not filled the hand of a reaper, || And the bosom of a binder of sheaves.
\v 8 And the passers by have not said, “The blessing of YHWH [is] on you, || We blessed you in the Name of YHWH!”
\c 130
\p
\v 1 A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. I have called You from the depths, YHWH.
\v 2 Lord, listen to my voice, || Your ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications.
\v 3 If You observe iniquities, Lord YAH, who stands?
\v 4 But forgiveness [is] with You, that You may be feared.
\v 5 I hoped [for] YHWH—my soul has hoped, || And I have waited for His word.
\v 6 My soul [is] for the Lord, || More than those watching for morning, || Watching for morning!
\v 7 Israel waits on YHWH, || For kindness [is] with YHWH, || And redemption [is] abundant with Him.
\v 8 And He redeems Israel from all his iniquities!
\c 131
\p
\v 1 A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. BY DAVID. YHWH, my heart has not been haughty, || Nor have my eyes been high, || Nor have I walked in great things, || And in things too wonderful for me.
\v 2 Have I not compared, and kept my soul silent, || As a weaned one by its mother? As a weaned one by me [is] my soul.
\v 3 Israel waits on YHWH, || From now on, and for all time!
\c 132
\p
\v 1 A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. Remember, YHWH, for David, all his afflictions;
\v 2 Who has sworn to YHWH, || He has vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
\v 3 “If I enter into the tent of my house, || If I go up on the couch of my bed,
\v 4 If I give sleep to my eyes, || To my eyelids—slumber,
\v 5 Until I find a place for YHWH, dwelling places for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
\v 6 Behold, we have heard it in Ephratah, || We have found it in the fields of the forest.
\v 7 We come into His dwelling places, || We bow ourselves at His footstool.
\v 8 Arise, O YHWH, to Your rest, || You, and the Ark of Your strength,
\v 9 Your priests put on righteousness, || And Your pious ones cry aloud.
\v 10 For the sake of Your servant David, || Do not turn back the face of Your anointed.
\v 11 YHWH has sworn truth to David, || He does not turn back from it: “Of the fruit of your body, || I set on the throne for you.
\v 12 If your sons keep My covenant, || And My testimonies that I teach them, || Their sons also forever and ever || Sit on the throne for you.”
\v 13 For YHWH has fixed on Zion, || He has desired [it] for a seat to Himself,
\v 14 “This [is] My rest forever and ever, || Here I sit, for I have desired it.
\v 15 I greatly bless her provision, || I satisfy her poor [with] bread,
\v 16 And I clothe her priests [with] salvation, || And her pious ones sing aloud.
\v 17 There I cause a horn to spring up for David, || I have arranged a lamp for My Anointed.
\v 18 I clothe His enemies [with] shame, || And His crown flourishes on Him!”
\c 133
\p
\v 1 A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. BY DAVID. Behold, how good and how pleasant || The dwelling of brothers—even together!
\v 2 As the good oil on the head, || Coming down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, || That comes down on the skirt of his robes,
\v 3 As dew of Hermon—That comes down on hills of Zion, || For there YHWH commanded the blessing—Life for all time!
\c 134
\p
\v 1 A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. Behold, bless YHWH, all servants of YHWH, || Who are standing in the house of YHWH by night.
\v 2 Lift up your hands [in] the sanctuary, || And bless YHWH.
\v 3 YHWH blesses you out of Zion, || The Maker of the heavens and earth!
\c 135
\p
\v 1 Praise YAH! Praise the Name of YHWH, || Praise, you servants of YHWH,
\v 2 Who are standing in the house of YHWH, || In the courts of the house of our God.
\v 3 Praise YAH! For YHWH [is] good, || Sing praise to His Name, for [it is] pleasant.
\v 4 For YAH has chosen Jacob for Himself, || Israel for His peculiar treasure.
\v 5 For I have known that YHWH [is] great, || Indeed, our Lord [is] above all gods.
\v 6 All that YHWH pleased He has done, || In the heavens and in earth, || In the seas and all deep places,
\v 7 Causing vapors to ascend from the end of the earth, || He has made lightnings for the rain, || Bringing forth wind from His treasures.
\v 8 Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, || From man to beast.
\v 9 He sent tokens and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, || On Pharaoh and on all his servants.
\v 10 Who struck many nations, and slew strong kings,
\v 11 Even Sihon king of the Amorite, || And Og king of Bashan, || And all kingdoms of Canaan.
\v 12 And He gave their land an inheritance, || An inheritance to His people Israel,
\v 13 O YHWH, Your Name [is] for all time, || O YHWH, Your memorial from generation to generation.
\v 14 For YHWH judges His people, || And comforts Himself for His servants.
\v 15 The idols of the nations [are] silver and gold, || Work of the hands of man.
\v 16 They have a mouth, and they do not speak, || They have eyes, and they do not see,
\v 17 They have ears, and they do not give ear, || Nose—there is no breath in their mouth!
\v 18 Their makers are like them, || Everyone who is trusting in them.
\v 19 O house of Israel, bless YHWH, || O house of Aaron, bless YHWH,
\v 20 O house of Levi, bless YHWH, || Those fearing YHWH, bless YHWH.
\v 21 Blessed [is] YHWH from Zion, || Inhabiting Jerusalem—praise YAH!
\c 136
\p

\v 7 To Him making great lights, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 8 The sun to rule by day, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 9 The moon and stars to rule by night, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 10 To Him striking Egypt in their firstborn, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 11 And bringing forth Israel from their midst, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 12 By a strong hand and an outstretched-arm, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 13 To Him cutting the Sea of Suph into parts, || For His kindness [is] for all time,
\v 14 And caused Israel to pass through its midst, || For His kindness [is] for all time,
\v 15 And shook out Pharaoh and his force in the Sea of Suph, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 16 To Him leading His people in a wilderness, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 17 To Him striking great kings, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 18 Indeed, He slays majestic kings, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 19 Even Sihon king of the Amorite, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 20 And Og king of Bashan, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 21 And He gave their land for inheritance, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 22 An inheritance to Israel His servant, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 23 Who has remembered us in our lowliness, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 24 And He delivers us from our adversaries, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 25 Giving food to all flesh, || For His kindness [is] for all time.
\v 26 Give thanks to the God of the heavens, || For His kindness [is] for all time!
\c 137
\p
\v 1 By rivers of Babylon—There we sat, || Indeed, we wept when we remembered Zion.
\v 2 We hung our harps on willows in its midst.
\v 3 For there our captors asked us the words of a song, || And our spoilers—joy: “Sing to us of a song of Zion.”
\v 4 How do we sing the song of YHWH, || On the land of a stranger?
\v 5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem, my right hand forgets!
\v 6 My tongue cleaves to my palate, || If I do not remember you, || If I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy.
\v 7 Remember, YHWH, for the sons of Edom, || The day of Jerusalem, || Those saying, “Raze, raze to its foundation!”
\v 8 O daughter of Babylon, O destroyed one, || O the blessedness of him who repays to you your deed, || That you have done to us.
\v 9 O the blessedness of him who seizes, and has dashed your sucklings on the rock!
\c 138
\p
\v 1 BY DAVID. I confess You with all my heart, || I praise You before the gods.
\v 2 I bow myself toward Your holy temple, || And I confess Your Name, || For Your kindness, and for Your truth, || For You have made Your saying great above all Your Name.
\v 3 In the day I called, when You answer me, || You strengthen me in my soul [with] strength.
\v 4 O YHWH, all kings of earth confess You, || When they have heard the sayings of Your mouth.
\v 5 And they sing in the ways of YHWH, || For the glory of YHWH [is] great.
\v 6 For YHWH [is] high, and He sees the lowly, || And He knows the haughty from afar.
\v 7 If I walk in the midst of distress You quicken me, || You send forth Your hand against the anger of my enemies, || And Your right hand saves me.
\v 8 YHWH perfects for me, || O YHWH, Your kindness [is] for all time, || Do not let the works of Your hands fall!
\c 139
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH, You have searched me, and know.
\v 2 You have known my sitting down, || And my rising up, || You have attended to my thoughts from afar.
\v 3 You have fanned my path and my lying down, || And have been acquainted [with] all my ways.
\v 4 For there is not a word in my tongue, || Behold, O YHWH, You have known it all!
\v 5 You have besieged me behind and before, || And You place Your hand on me.
\v 6 Knowledge too wonderful for me, || It has been set on high, || I am not able for it.
\v 7 To where do I go from Your Spirit? And to where do I flee from Your face?
\v 8 If I ascend the heavens—You [are] there, || And spread out a bed in Sheol, behold, You!
\v 9 I take the wings of morning, || I dwell in the uttermost part of the sea,
\v 10 Also there Your hand leads me, || And Your right hand holds me.
\v 11 And I say, “Surely darkness bruises me,” || Then night [is] light to me.
\v 12 Also darkness does not hide from You, || And night shines as day, || As [is] darkness so [is] light.
\v 13 For You have possessed my reins, || You cover me in my mother’s belly.
\v 14 I confess You, because I have been fearfully distinguished. Your works [are] wonderful, || And my soul is knowing [it] well.
\v 15 My substance was not hid from You, || When I was made in secret, || Curiously worked in the lower part of earth.
\v 16 Your eyes saw my unformed substance, || And all of them are written on Your scroll, || The days they were formed—And not one among them.
\v 17 And how precious Your thoughts have been to me, || O God, how great has been their sum!
\v 18 I recount them! They are more than the sand, || I have awoken, and I am still with You.
\v 19 Do You slay, O God, the wicked? Then, men of blood, turn aside from me!
\v 20 Who exchange You for wickedness, || Your enemies [are] lifted up to vanity.
\v 21 Do I not hate, YHWH, those hating You? And grieve myself with Your withstanders?
\v 22 I have hated them [with] perfect hatred, || They have become enemies to me.
\v 23 Search me, O God, and know my heart, || Try me, and know my thoughts,
\v 24 And see if a grievous way be in me, || And lead me in a perpetual way!
\c 140
\p
\v 1 TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. Deliver me, O YHWH, from an evil man, || Keep me from one of violence.
\v 2 Who have devised evils in the heart, || All the day they assemble [for] wars.
\v 3 They sharpened their tongue as a serpent, || Poison of a viper [is] under their lips. Selah.
\v 4 Preserve me, YHWH, from the hands of the wicked, || Keep me from one of violence, || Who have devised to overthrow my steps.
\v 5 The proud hid a snare for me—and cords, || They spread a net by the side of the path, || They have set snares for me. Selah.
\v 6 I have said to YHWH, “You [are] my God, || Hear, YHWH, the voice of my supplications.”
\v 7 O YHWH, my Lord, strength of my salvation, || You have covered my head in the day of armor.
\v 8 Do not grant, O YHWH, the desires of the wicked, || Do not bring forth his wicked scheme, || They are high. Selah.
\v 9 The chief of my surrounders, || The perverseness of their lips covers them.
\v 10 They cause burning coals to fall on themselves, || He casts them into fire, || Into deep pits—they do not arise.
\v 11 A talkative man is not established in the earth, || One of violence—evil hunts to overflowing.
\v 12 I have known that YHWH executes || The judgment of the afflicted, || The judgment of the needy.
\v 13 Surely the righteous give thanks to Your Name, || The upright dwell with Your presence!
\c 141
\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF DAVID. O YHWH, I have called You, hurry to me, || Give ear [to] my voice when I call to You.
\v 2 My prayer is prepared—incense before You, || The lifting up of my hands—the evening present.
\v 3 Set, O YHWH, a watch for my mouth, || Watch over the door of my lips.
\v 4 Do not incline my heart to an evil thing, || To habitually do actions in wickedness, || Working iniquity with men, || Indeed, I do not eat of their pleasant things.
\v 5 The righteous beat me [in] kindness. And reprove me, || My head does not disallow oil of the head, || For my prayer [is] still about their distress.
\v 6 Their judges have been released by the sides of a rock, || And they have heard my sayings, || For they have been pleasant.
\v 7 As one tilling and ripping up in the land, || Have our bones been scattered at the command of Saul.
\v 8 But to You, O YHWH, my Lord, [are] my eyes, || In You I have trusted, || Do not make my soul bare.
\v 9 Keep me from the trap they laid for me, || Even snares of workers of iniquity.
\v 10 The wicked fall in their dragnets together, until I pass over!
\c 142
\p
\v 1 AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID. A PRAYER WHEN HE IS IN THE CAVE. My voice [is] to YHWH, I cry, || My voice [is] to YHWH, I beg [for] grace.
\v 2 I pour forth my meditation before Him, || I declare my distress before Him.
\v 3 When my spirit has been feeble in me, || Then You have known my path; In the way [in] which I walk, || They have hid a snare for me.
\v 4 Looking on the right hand—and seeing, || And I have none recognizing; Refuge has perished from me, || There is none inquiring for my soul.
\v 5 I have cried to you, O YHWH, || I have said, “You [are] my refuge, || My portion in the land of the living.”
\v 6 Attend to my loud cry, || For I have become very low, || Deliver me from my pursuers, || For they have been stronger than I.
\v 7 Bring forth my soul from prison to confess Your Name, || The righteous surround me about, || When You confer benefits on me!
\c 143
\p
\v 1 A PSALM OF DAVID. O YHWH, hear my prayer, || Give ear to my supplications, || Answer me in Your faithfulness—in Your righteousness.
\v 2 And do not enter into judgment with Your servant, || For no one living is justified before You.
\v 3 For an enemy has pursued my soul, || He has bruised my life to the earth, || He has caused me to dwell in dark places, || As the dead of old.
\v 4 And my spirit has become feeble in me, || My heart has become desolate within me.
\v 5 I have remembered days of old, || I have meditated on all Your acts, || I muse on the work of Your hand.
\v 6 I have spread forth my hands to You, || My soul [is] as a weary land for You. Selah.
\v 7 Hurry, answer me, O YHWH, || My spirit has been consumed, || Do not hide Your face from me, || Or I have been compared with those going down [to] the pit.
\v 8 Cause me to hear Your kindness in the morning, || For I have trusted in You, || Cause me to know the way that I go, || For I have lifted up my soul to You.
\v 9 Deliver me from my enemies, O YHWH, || Near You I am covered.
\v 10 Teach me to do Your good pleasure, || For You [are] my God—Your Spirit [is] good, || Lead me into a land of uprightness.
\v 11 You quicken me for Your Name’s sake, O YHWH, || In Your righteousness, You bring out my soul from distress,
\v 12 And in Your kindness cut off my enemies, || And have destroyed all the adversaries of my soul, || For I [am] Your servant!
\c 144
\p
\v 1 BY DAVID. Blessed [is] YHWH my Rock, || Who is teaching My hands for war, || My fingers for battle.
\v 2 My kind one, and my bulwark, || My tower, and my deliverer, || My shield, and in whom I have trusted, || Who is subduing my people under me!
\v 3 YHWH, what [is] man that You know him? The son of man, that You esteem him?
\v 4 Man has been like a breath, || His days [are] as a shadow passing by.
\v 5 YHWH, incline Your heavens and come down, || Strike against mountains, and they smoke.
\v 6 Send forth lightning, and scatter them, || Send forth Your arrows, and trouble them,
\v 7 Send forth Your hand from on high, || Free me, and deliver me from many waters, || From the hand of sons of a stranger,
\v 8 Because their mouth has spoken vanity, || And their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood.
\v 9 O God, I sing to You a new song, || I sing praise to You on a stringed instrument of ten strings.
\v 10 Who is giving deliverance to kings, || Who is freeing His servant David from the sword of evil.
\v 11 Free me, and deliver me || From the hand of sons of a stranger, || Because their mouth has spoken vanity, || And their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood,
\v 12 Because our sons [are] as plants, || Becoming great in their youth, || Our daughters as hewn stones, || Polished—the likeness of a palace,
\v 13 Our granaries [are] full, bringing out from kind to kind, || Our flocks are bringing forth thousands, || Ten thousands in our out-places,
\v 14 Our oxen are carrying, there is no breach, || And there is no outgoing, || And there is no crying in our broad places.
\v 15 O the blessedness of the people that is thus, || O the blessedness of the people whose God [is] YHWH!
\c 145
\p
\v 1 A PRAISE [SONG] OF DAVID. [ALEPH-BET] I exalt You, my God, O king, || And bless Your Name for all time and forever.
\v 2 Every day I bless You, || And praise Your Name for all time and forever.
\v 3 YHWH [is] great, and greatly praised, || And there is no searching of His greatness.
\v 4 Generation to generation praises Your works, || And they declare Your mighty acts.
\v 5 The majesty, the glory of Your splendor, || And the matters of Your wonders, I declare.
\v 6 And they tell of the strength of Your fearful acts, || And I recount Your greatness.
\v 7 They send forth the memorial of the abundance of Your goodness. And they sing of Your righteousness.
\v 8 YHWH [is] gracious and merciful, || Slow to anger, and great in kindness.
\v 9 YHWH [is] good to all, || And His mercies [are] over all His works.
\v 10 O YHWH, all Your works confess You, || And Your saints bless You.
\v 11 They tell of the glory of Your kingdom, || And they speak of Your might,
\v 12 To make His mighty acts known to sons of men, || The glory of the majesty of His kingdom.
\v 13 Your kingdom [is] a kingdom of all ages, || And Your dominion [is] in all generations. \bd [[\bd*YHWH [is] faithful in all His words, || And kind in all His works.\bd ]]\bd*
\v 14 YHWH is supporting all who are falling, || And raising up all who are bowed down.
\v 15 The eyes of all look to You, || And You are giving their food to them in its season,
\v 16 Opening Your hand, and satisfying || The desire of every living thing.
\v 17 YHWH [is] righteous in all His ways, || And kind in all His works.
\v 18 YHWH [is] near to all those calling Him, || To all who call Him in truth.
\v 19 He does the desire of those fearing Him, || And He hears their cry, and saves them.
\v 20 YHWH preserves all those loving Him, || And He destroys all the wicked.
\v 21 My mouth speaks the praise of YHWH, || And all flesh blesses His Holy Name, || For all time and forever!
\c 146
\p
\v 1 Praise YAH! Praise, O my soul, YHWH.
\v 2 I praise YHWH during my life, || I sing praise to my God while I exist.
\v 3 Do not trust in princes—in a son of man, || For he has no deliverance.
\v 4 His spirit goes forth, he returns to his earth, || In that day his thoughts have perished.
\v 5 O the blessedness of him || Who has the God of Jacob for his help, || His hope [is] on his God YHWH,
\v 6 Making the heavens and earth, || The sea and all that [is] in them, || Who is keeping truth for all time,
\v 7 Doing judgment for the oppressed, || Giving bread to the hungry.
\v 8 YHWH is loosing the prisoners, || YHWH is opening (the eyes of) the blind, || YHWH is raising the bowed down, || YHWH is loving the righteous,
\v 9 YHWH is preserving the strangers, || He causes the fatherless and widow to stand, || And He turns the way of the wicked upside down.
\v 10 YHWH reigns for all time, || Your God, O Zion, to generation and generation, || Praise YAH!
\c 147
\p
\v 1 Praise YAH! For [it is] good to praise our God, || For pleasant—lovely [is] praise.
\v 2 YHWH [is] building Jerusalem, || He gathers the driven away of Israel.
\v 3 Who is giving healing to the broken of heart, || And is binding up their griefs.
\v 4 Appointing the number of the stars, || He gives names to all of them.
\v 5 Our Lord [is] great, and abundant in power, || There is no narration of His understanding.
\v 6 YHWH is causing the meek to stand, || Making the wicked low to the earth.
\v 7 Answer to YHWH with thanksgiving, || Sing to our God with a harp.
\v 8 Who is covering the heavens with clouds, || Who is preparing rain for the earth, || Who is causing grass to spring up [on] mountains,
\v 9 Giving to the beast its food, || To the young of the ravens that call.
\v 10 He does not delight in the might of the horse, || He is not pleased in the legs of a man.
\v 11 YHWH is pleased with those fearing Him, || With those waiting for His kindness.
\v 12 Glorify, O Jerusalem, YHWH, || Praise your God, O Zion.
\v 13 For He strengthened the bars of your gates, || He has blessed your sons in your midst.
\v 14 Who is making your border peace, || He satisfies you [with] the fat of wheat.
\v 15 Who is sending forth His saying [on] earth, || His word runs very speedily.
\v 16 Who is giving snow like wool, || He scatters hoarfrost as ashes.
\v 17 Casting forth His ice like morsels, || Who stands before His cold?
\v 18 He sends forth His word and melts them, || He causes His wind to blow—the waters flow.
\v 19 Declaring His words to Jacob, || His statutes and His judgments to Israel.
\v 20 He has not done so to any nation, || As for judgments, they have not known them. Praise YAH!

\v 1 Praise YAH! Praise YHWH from the heavens, || Praise Him in high places.
\v 2 Praise Him, all His messengers, || Praise Him, all His hosts.
\v 3 Praise Him, sun and moon, || Praise Him, all stars of light.
\v 4 Praise Him, heavens of heavens, || And you waters that are above the heavens.
\v 5 They praise the Name of YHWH, || For He commanded, and they were created.
\v 6 And He establishes them forever and for all time, || He gave a statute, and they do not pass over.
\v 7 Praise YHWH from the earth, || Dragons and all deeps,
\v 8 Fire and hail, snow and vapor, || Whirlwind doing His word;
\v 9 The mountains and all heights, || Fruit tree, and all cedars,
\v 10 The wild beast, and all livestock, || Creeping thing, and winged bird,
\v 11 Kings of earth, and all peoples, || Chiefs, and all judges of earth,
\v 12 Young men, and also maidens, || Aged men, with youths,
\v 13 They praise the Name of YHWH, || For His Name alone has been set on high, || His splendor [is] above earth and heavens.
\v 14 And He exalts the horn of His people, || The praise of all His saints, || Of the sons of Israel, || A people near Him. Praise YAH!
\c 149

\v 1 Praise YAH! Sing to YHWH a new song, || His praise in an assembly of saints.
\v 2 Israel rejoices in his Maker, || Sons of Zion rejoice in their king.
\v 3 They praise His Name in a dance, || Sing praise to Him with timbrel and harp.
\v 4 For YHWH is pleased with His people, || He beautifies the humble with salvation.
\v 5 Saints exult in glory, || They sing aloud on their beds.
\v 6 The exaltation of God [is] in their throat, || And a two-edged sword in their hand.
\v 7 To do vengeance among nations, || Punishments among the peoples.
\v 8 To bind their kings with chains, || And their honored ones with chains of iron,
\v 9 To do among them the judgment written, || It [is] an honor for all his saints. Praise YAH!

\v 3 Praise Him with blowing of horn, || Praise Him with stringed instrument and harp.
\v 4 Praise Him with timbrel and dance, || Praise Him with stringed instruments and pipe.
\v 5 Praise Him with cymbals of sounding, || Praise Him with cymbals of shouting.
\v 6 All that breathes praise YAH! Praise YAH!
