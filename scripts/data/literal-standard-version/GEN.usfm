\v 1 In [the] beginning God created the heavens and the earth,
\v 2 and the earth was formless and void, and darkness [was] on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God [was] fluttering on the face of the waters,
\v 3 and God says, “Let light be”; and light is.
\v 4 And God sees that the light [is] good, and God separates between the light and the darkness,
\v 5 and God calls the light “Day,” and the darkness He has called “Night”; and there is an evening, and there is a morning—day one.
\v 6 And God says, “Let an expanse be in the midst of the waters, and let it be separating between waters and waters.”
\v 7 And God makes the expanse, and it separates between the waters which [are] under the expanse, and the waters which [are] above the expanse: and it is so.
\v 8 And God calls the expanse “Heavens”; and there is an evening, and there is a morning—[the] second day.
\v 9 And God says, “Let the waters under the heavens be collected to one place, and let the dry land be seen”: and it is so.
\v 10 And God calls the dry land “Earth,” and the collection of the waters He has called “Seas”; and God sees that [it is] good.
\v 11 And God says, “Let the earth yield tender grass, herb sowing seed, fruit-tree (whose seed [is] in itself) making fruit after its kind, on the earth”: and it is so.
\v 12 And the earth brings forth tender grass, herb sowing seed after its kind, and tree making fruit (whose seed [is] in itself) after its kind; and God sees that [it is] good;
\v 13 and there is an evening, and there is a morning—[the] third day.
\v 14 And God says, “Let luminaries be in the expanse of the heavens, to make a separation between the day and the night, then they have been for signs, and for appointed times, and for days and years,
\v 15 and they have been for luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth”: and it is so.
\v 16 And God makes the two great luminaries, the great luminary for the rule of the day, and the small luminary—and the stars—for the rule of the night;
\v 17 and God gives them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,
\v 18 and to rule over day and over night, and to make a separation between the light and the darkness; and God sees that [it is] good;
\v 19 and there is an evening, and there is a morning—[the] fourth day.
\v 20 And God says, “Let the waters teem with the teeming living creature, and let [the] bird fly above the earth on the face of the expanse of the heavens.”
\v 21 And God creates the great dragons, and every living creature that is creeping, which the waters have teemed with, after their kind, and every bird with wing, after its kind, and God sees that [it is] good.
\v 22 And God blesses them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the bird multiply in the earth”:
\v 23 and there is an evening, and there is a morning—[the] fifth day.
\v 24 And God says, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, livestock and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind”: and it is so.
\v 25 And God makes the beast of the earth after its kind, and the livestock after their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, and God sees that [it is] good.
\v 26 And God says, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them rule over [the] fish of the sea, and over [the] bird of the heavens, and over livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth.”
\v 27 And God creates the man in His image; in the image of God He created him, a male and a female He created them.
\v 28 And God blesses them, and God says to them, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over [the] fish of the sea, and over [the] bird of the heavens, and over every living thing that is creeping on the earth.”
\v 29 And God says, “Behold, I have given to you every herb sowing seed, which [is] on the face of all the earth, and every tree in which [is] the fruit of a tree sowing seed, to you it is for food;
\v 30 and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to every creeping thing on the earth, in which [is] breath of life, every green herb [is] for food”: and it is so.
\v 31 And God sees all that He has done, and behold, [it is] very good; and there is an evening, and there is a morning—the sixth day.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 And the heavens and the earth are completed, and all their host;
\v 2 and God completes by the seventh day His work which He has made, and ceases by the seventh day from all His work which He has made.
\v 3 And God blesses the seventh day, and sanctifies it, for in it He has ceased from all His work which God had created for making.
\v 4 These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth in their being created, in the day of YHWH God’s making the earth and the heavens;
\v 5 and no shrub of the field is yet in the earth, and no herb of the field yet sprouts, for YHWH God has not rained on the earth, and there is not a man to serve the ground,
\v 6 and a mist goes up from the earth, and has watered the whole face of the ground.
\v 7 And YHWH God forms the man—dust from the ground, and breathes into his nostrils breath of life, and the man becomes a living creature.
\v 8 And YHWH God plants a garden in Eden, at the east, and He sets there the man whom He has formed;
\v 9 and YHWH God causes to sprout from the ground every tree desirable for appearance, and good for food, and the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.
\v 10 And a river is going out from Eden to water the garden, and from there it is parted, and has become four chief [rivers];
\v 11 the name of the first [is] Pison, it [is] that which is surrounding the whole land of Havilah where the gold [is],
\v 12 and the gold of that land [is] good; the bdellium and the shoham stone [are] there;
\v 13 and the name of the second river [is] Gihon, it [is] that which is surrounding the whole land of Cush;
\v 14 and the name of the third river [is] Hiddekel, it [is] that which is going east of Asshur; and the fourth river is the Euphrates.
\v 15 And YHWH God takes the man, and causes him to rest in the Garden of Eden, to serve it and to keep it.
\v 16 And YHWH God lays a charge on the man, saying, “From every tree of the garden eating you eat;
\v 17 but from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, you do not eat from it, for in the day of your eating from it—dying you die.”
\v 18 And YHWH God says, “[It is] not good for the man to be alone; I make him a helper as his counterpart.”
\v 19 And YHWH God forms from the ground every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens, and brings [them] to the man, to see what he calls it; and whatever the man calls a living creature, that [is] its name.
\v 20 And the man calls names to all the livestock, and to bird of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man a helper has not been found as his counterpart.
\v 21 And YHWH God causes a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he sleeps, and He takes one of his ribs, and closes up flesh in its stead.
\v 22 And YHWH God builds up the rib which He has taken out of the man into a woman, and brings her to the man;
\v 23 and the man says, “This at last! Bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh!” For this is called Woman, for this has been taken from Man;
\v 24 therefore a man leaves his father and his mother, and has cleaved to his wife, and they have become one flesh.
\v 25 And both of them are naked, the man and his wife, and they are not ashamed of themselves.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 And the serpent has been cunning above every beast of the field which YHWH God has made, and he says to the woman, “Is it true that God has said, You do not eat from every tree of the garden?”
\v 2 And the woman says to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we eat,
\v 3 but from the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God has said, You do not eat of it, nor touch it, lest you die.”
\v 4 And the serpent says to the woman, “Dying, you do not die,
\v 5 for God knows that in the day of your eating of it—your eyes have been opened, and you have been as God, knowing good and evil.”
\v 6 And the woman sees that the tree [is] good for food, and that it [is] pleasant to the eyes, and the tree is desirable to make [one] wise, and she takes from its fruit and eats, and also gives [some] to her husband with her, and he eats;
\v 7 and the eyes of them both are opened, and they know that they [are] naked, and they sew fig-leaves, and make girdles for themselves.
\v 8 And they hear the sound of YHWH God walking up and down in the garden at the breeze of the day, and the man and his wife hide themselves from the face of YHWH God in the midst of the trees of the garden.
\v 9 And YHWH God calls to the man and says to him, “Where [are] you?”
\v 10 And he says, “I have heard Your sound in the garden, and I am afraid, for I am naked, and I hide myself.”
\v 11 And He says, “Who has declared to you that you [are] naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I have commanded you not to eat?”
\v 12 And the man says, “The woman whom You placed with me—she has given to me from the tree, and I eat.”
\v 13 And YHWH God says to the woman, “What [is] this you have done?” And the woman says, “The serpent has caused me to forget, and I eat.”
\v 14 And YHWH God says to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed [are] you above all the livestock, and above every beast of the field: on your belly you go, and dust you eat, [for] all days of your life;
\v 15 and I put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He bruises your head, and you bruise His heel.”
\v 16 To the woman He said, “Multiplying I multiply your sorrow and your conception; you will bear children in sorrow, and your desire [is] toward your Man \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* husband\bd ]]\bd*, and He \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* he\bd ]]\bd* will rule over you.”
\v 17 And to the man He said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and eat from the tree concerning which I have charged you, saying, You do not eat of it, cursed [is] the ground on your account; in sorrow you eat of it [for] all days of your life,
\v 18 and it brings forth thorn and bramble for you, and you have eaten the herb of the field;
\v 19 by the sweat of your face you eat bread until your return to the ground, for you have been taken out of it, for dust you [are], and to dust you return.”
\v 20 And the man calls his wife’s name Eve, for she has been mother of all living.
\v 21 And YHWH God makes coats of skin [for] the man and his wife, and clothes them.
\v 22 And YHWH God says, “Behold, the man was as one of Us, as to the knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he send forth his hand, and has also taken from the Tree of Life, and eaten, and lived for all time.”
\v 23 YHWH God sends him forth from the Garden of Eden to serve the ground from which he has been taken;
\v 24 indeed, He casts out the man, and causes the cherubim to dwell at the east of the Garden of Eden with the sword of flame whirling around to guard the way of the Tree of Life.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 And the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceives and bears Cain, and says, “I have acquired a man by YHWH”;
\v 2 and she adds to bear his brother, even Abel. And Abel is feeding a flock, and Cain has been servant of the ground.
\v 3 And it comes to pass at the end of days that Cain brings from the fruit of the ground a present to YHWH;
\v 4 and Abel, he has brought, he also, from the female firstlings of his flock, and from their fat ones; and YHWH looks to Abel and to his present,
\v 5 and to Cain and to his present He has not looked; and it is very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance is fallen.
\v 6 And YHWH says to Cain, “Why do you have displeasure? And why has your countenance fallen?
\v 7 Is there not, if you do well, acceptance? And if you do not do well, sin \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* a sin-offering\bd ]]\bd* is lying at the opening, and its \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* His\bd ]]\bd* desire [is] for you, and you rule over it \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* by Him\bd ]]\bd*.”
\v 8 And Cain says to his brother Abel, \bd [[\bd*“Let us go into the field”;\bd ]]\bd* and it comes to pass in their being in the field, that Cain rises up against his brother Abel, and slays him.
\v 9 And YHWH says to Cain, “Where [is] your brother Abel?” And he says, “I have not known; am I my brother’s keeper?”
\v 10 And He says, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to Me from the ground;
\v 11 and now, cursed [are] you from the ground, which has opened her mouth to receive the blood of your brother from your hand;
\v 12 when you till the ground, it will not add to give its strength to you—a wanderer, even a trembling one, you are in the earth.”
\v 13 And Cain says to YHWH, “My punishment is too great than to bear;
\v 14 behold, You have driven me today from off the face of the ground, and from Your face I am hid; and I have been a wanderer, even a trembling one, in the earth, and it has been—everyone finding me will slay me.”
\v 15 And YHWH says to him, “Therefore, of any slayer of Cain it is required sevenfold”; and YHWH sets to Cain a token that none finding him will slay him.
\v 16 And Cain goes out from before YHWH, and dwells in the land, moving about east of Eden;
\v 17 and Cain knows his wife, and she conceives, and bears Enoch; and he is building a city, and he calls the name of the city, according to the name of his son—Enoch.
\v 18 And born to Enoch is Irad; and Irad has begotten Mehujael; and Mehujael has begotten Methusael; and Methusael has begotten Lamech.
\v 19 And Lamech takes to himself two wives, the name of the first Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.
\v 20 And Adah bears Jabal, he has been father of those inhabiting tents and [having] purchased livestock;
\v 21 and the name of his brother [is] Jubal, he has been father of everyone handling harp and pipe.
\v 22 And Zillah, she also bears Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron; and a sister of Tubal-Cain [is] Naamah.
\v 23 And Lamech says to his wives: “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, give ear [to] my saying: For I have slain a man for my wound, || Even a young man for my hurt;
\v 24 For sevenfold is required for Cain, || And for Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”
\v 25 And Adam again knows his wife, and she bears a son, and calls his name Seth, “for God has appointed for me another seed instead of Abel”: for Cain had slain him.
\v 26 And to Seth, to him also a son has been born, and he calls his name Enos; then a beginning was made of preaching in the Name of YHWH.

\p
\v 1 This [is] an account of the generations of Adam. In the day of God’s creating man, in the likeness of God He has made him;
\v 2 a male and a female He has created them, and He blesses them, and calls their name Man, in the day of their being created.
\v 3 And Adam lives one hundred and thirty years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* two hundred and thirty years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets [a son] in his likeness, according to his image, and calls his name Seth.
\v 4 And the days of Adam after his begetting Seth are eight hundred years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* seven hundred years\bd ]]\bd*, and he begets sons and daughters.

\v 13 And Cainan lives after his begetting Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* seven hundred and forty years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 14 And all the days of Cainan are nine hundred and ten years, and he dies.
\v 15 And Mahalaleel lives sixty-five years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* one hundred and sixty-five years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets Jared.
\v 16 And Mahalaleel lives after his begetting Jared eight hundred and thirty years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* seven hundred and thirty years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 17 And all the days of Mahalaleel are eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he dies.
\v 18 And Jared lives one hundred and sixty-two years, and begets Enoch.
\v 19 And Jared lives after his begetting Enoch eight hundred years, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 20 And all the days of Jared are nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he dies.
\v 21 And Enoch lives sixty-five years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* one hundred and sixty-five years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets Methuselah.
\v 22 And Enoch habitually walks with God after his begetting Methuselah three hundred years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* two hundred years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 23 And all the days of Enoch are three hundred and sixty-five years.
\v 24 And Enoch habitually walks with God, and he is not, for God has taken him.
\v 25 And Methuselah lives one hundred and eighty-seven years, and begets Lamech.
\v 26 And Methuselah lives after his begetting Lamech seven hundred and eighty-two years, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 27 And all the days of Methuselah are nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he dies.
\v 28 And Lamech lives one hundred and eighty-two years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* one hundred and eighty-eight years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets a son,
\v 29 and calls his name Noah, saying, “This [one] comforts us concerning our work, and concerning the labor of our hands, because of the ground which YHWH has cursed.”
\v 30 And Lamech lives after his begetting Noah five hundred and ninety-five years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* five hundred and sixty-five years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 31 And all the days of Lamech are seven hundred and seventy-seven years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* seven hundred and fifty-three years\bd ]]\bd*, and he dies.
\v 32 And Noah is a son of five hundred years, and Noah begets Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 And it comes to pass that mankind has begun to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters have been born to them,
\v 2 and the sons of God see that they, the daughters of men, [are] beautiful, and they take women for themselves of all whom they have chosen.
\v 3 And YHWH says, “My Spirit does not strive in man for all time, for indeed, he [is] flesh, but his days have been one hundred and twenty years.”
\v 4 The giants were in the earth in those days, and even afterward, when sons of God come in to the daughters of men, and they have borne to them those who [were] the mighty from of old, the men of renown.
\v 5 And YHWH sees that the wickedness of man [is] abundant in the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart [is] only evil every day;
\v 6 and YHWH regrets that He has made man in the earth, and He grieves Himself—to His heart.
\v 7 And YHWH says, “I wipe away man whom I have created from off the face of the ground, from man to beast, to creeping thing, and to bird of the heavens, for I have regretted that I have made them.”
\v 8 And Noah found grace in the eyes of YHWH.
\v 9 These [are] the generations of Noah: Noah [is] a righteous man; he has been perfect among his generations; Noah has habitually walked with God.
\v 10 And Noah begets three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
\v 11 And the earth is corrupt before God, and the earth is filled [with] violence.
\v 12 And God sees the earth, and behold, it has been corrupted, for all flesh has corrupted its way on the earth.
\v 13 And God said to Noah, “An end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth has been full of violence from their presence; and behold, I am destroying them with the earth.
\v 14 Make an ark of gopher-wood for yourself; you make rooms within the Ark, and you have covered it from inside and from outside with pitch;
\v 15 and this [is] how you do it: three hundred cubits [is] the length of the Ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height;
\v 16 you make a window for the Ark, and you finish it to a cubit from above; and you put the opening of the Ark in its side; you make it [with] lower, second, and third [stories].
\v 17 And I, behold, I am bringing in the flood of waters on the earth, to destroy from under the heavens all flesh in which [is] a living spirit; all that [is] in the earth expires.
\v 18 And I have established My covenant with you, and you have come into the Ark—you, and your sons, and your wife, and your son’s wives with you;
\v 19 and of all that lives, of all flesh, you bring two from every [kind] into the Ark, to keep alive with you; they are male and female.
\v 20 From the bird after its kind, and from the livestock after its kind, [and] from every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every [kind] they come to you, to keep alive.
\v 21 And you, take for yourself from all food that is eaten; and you have gathered [it] to yourself, and it has been for you and for them for food.”
\v 22 And Noah does according to all that God has commanded him; so he has done.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 And YHWH says to Noah, “Come, you and all your house, into the Ark, for I have seen you [are] righteous before Me in this generation;
\v 2 you take seven pairs from all the clean beasts to yourself, a male and its female; and of the beasts which are not clean—two, a male and its female;
\v 3 also, seven pairs from [each] bird of the heavens, a male and a female, to keep alive seed on the face of all the earth;
\v 4 for after seven more days I am sending rain on the earth [for] forty days and forty nights, and have wiped away all the substance that I have made from off the face of the ground.”
\v 5 And Noah does according to all that YHWH has commanded him.
\v 6 And Noah [is] a son of six hundred years, and the flood of waters has been on the earth.
\v 7 And Noah goes—and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him—into the Ark, out of the presence of the waters of the flood;
\v 8 from the clean beast, and from the beast that [is] not clean, and from the bird, and of everything that is creeping on the ground,
\v 9 they have come to Noah two by two into the Ark, a male and a female, as God has commanded Noah.
\v 10 And it comes to pass, after seven days, that waters of the flood have been on the earth.
\v 11 In the six hundredth year of the life of Noah, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on this day all [the] fountains of the great deep have been broken up, and the network of the heavens has been opened,
\v 12 and the shower is on the earth [for] forty days and forty nights.
\v 13 On this very same day Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the Ark—
\v 14 they, and every living creature after its kind, and every beast after its kind, and every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind (every bird, every wing).
\v 15 And they come to Noah, into the Ark, two by two of all the flesh in which [is] a living spirit;
\v 16 and they that are coming in, male and female of all flesh, have come in as God has commanded him, and YHWH closes [it] for him.
\v 17 And the flood is on the earth [for] forty days, and the waters multiply and lift up the Ark, and it is raised up from off the earth;
\v 18 and the waters are mighty and multiply exceedingly on the earth; and the Ark goes on the face of the waters.
\v 19 And the waters have been very, very mighty on the earth, and all the high mountains are covered which [are] under the whole heavens;
\v 20 the waters prevailed from above the mountains, and cover [them] fifteen cubits;
\v 21 and all flesh expires that is moving on the earth, among bird, and among livestock, and among beast, and among every teeming thing which is teeming on the earth, and all mankind;
\v 22 all in whose nostrils [is] breath of a living spirit—of all that [is] in the dry land—have died.
\v 23 And all the substance that is on the face of the ground is wiped away—from man to beast, to creeping thing, and to bird of the heavens; indeed, they are wiped away from the earth, and only Noah is left, and those who [are] with him in the Ark;
\v 24 and the waters are mighty on the earth [for] one hundred and fifty days.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 And God remembers Noah, and every living thing, and all the livestock which [are] with him in the Ark, and God causes a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subside,
\v 2 and the fountains of the deep and the network of the heavens are closed, and the shower is restrained from the heavens.
\v 3 And the waters return from off the earth, going on and returning; and the waters are lacking at the end of one hundred and fifty days.
\v 4 And the Ark rests, in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on mountains of Ararat;
\v 5 and the waters have been going and decreasing until the tenth month; in the tenth [month], on the first of the month, the heads of the mountains appeared.
\v 6 And it comes to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opens the window of the Ark which he made,
\v 7 and he sends forth the raven, and it goes out, going out and turning back until the drying of the waters from off the earth.
\v 8 And he sends forth the dove from him to see whether the waters have been lightened from off the face of the ground,
\v 9 and the dove has not found rest for the sole of her foot, and she turns back to him, to the Ark, for waters [are] on the face of all the earth, and he puts out his hand, and takes her, and brings her in to him, into the Ark.
\v 10 And he stays yet seven more days, and adds to send forth the dove from the Ark;
\v 11 and the dove comes to him at evening, and behold, an olive leaf [is] torn off in her mouth; and Noah knows that the waters have been lightened from off the earth.
\v 12 And he stays yet seven more days, and sends forth the dove, and it did not add to return to him anymore.
\v 13 And it comes to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first [month], on the first of the month, the waters have been dried from off the earth; and Noah turns aside the covering of the Ark, and looks, and behold, the face of the ground has been dried.
\v 14 And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth has become dry.
\v 15 And God speaks to Noah, saying, “Go out from the Ark, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons’ wives with you;
\v 16 every living thing that [is] with you, of all flesh, among bird, and among livestock, and among every creeping thing which is creeping on the earth, bring out with you;
\v 17 and they have teemed in the earth, and been fruitful, and have multiplied on the earth.”
\v 18 And Noah goes out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him;
\v 19 every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird; every creeping thing on the earth, after their families, have gone out from the Ark.
\v 20 And Noah builds an altar to YHWH, and takes from every clean beast and from every clean bird, and causes burnt-offerings to ascend on the altar;
\v 21 and YHWH smells the refreshing fragrance, and YHWH says to His heart, “I do not continue to disfavor the ground because of man anymore, though the imagination of the heart of man [is] evil from his youth; and I do not continue to strike all living anymore, as I have done;
\v 22 during all [the] days of the earth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night never cease.”
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And God blesses Noah and his sons, and says to them, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth;
\v 2 and your fear and your dread is on every beast of the earth, and on every bird of the heavens, on all that creeps on the ground, and on all fishes of the sea—into your hand they have been given.
\v 3 Every creeping thing that is alive, to you it is for food; as the green herb I have given to you the whole;
\v 4 only flesh in its life—its blood—you do not eat.
\v 5 And only your blood for your lives do I require; from the hand of every living thing I require it, and from the hand of man, from the hand of every man’s brother I require the life of man;
\v 6 whoever sheds man’s blood, by man is his blood shed: for in the image of God has He made man.
\v 7 And you, be fruitful and multiply, teem in the earth, and multiply in it.”
\v 8 And God speaks to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
\v 9 “And I, behold, I am establishing My covenant with you, and with your seed after you,
\v 10 and with every living creature which [is] with you, among bird, among livestock, and among every beast of the earth with you, from all who are going out of the Ark—to every beast of the earth.
\v 11 And I have established My covenant with you, and all flesh is not cut off anymore by waters of a flood, and there is not a flood to destroy the earth anymore.”
\v 12 And God says, “This is a token of the covenant which I am giving between Me and you, and every living creature that [is] with you, to continuous generations;
\v 13 My bow I have given in the cloud, and it has been for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth;
\v 14 and it has come to pass (in My sending a cloud over the earth) that the bow has been seen in the cloud,
\v 15 and I have remembered My covenant which is between Me and you, and every living creature among all flesh, and the waters no longer become a flood to destroy all flesh;
\v 16 and the bow has been in the cloud, and I have seen it—to remember the perpetual covenant between God and every living creature among all flesh which [is] on the earth.”
\v 17 And God says to Noah, “This [is] a token of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that [is] on the earth.”
\v 18 And the sons of Noah who are going out of the Ark are Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is father of Canaan.
\v 19 These three [are] sons of Noah, and from these has all the earth been overspread.
\v 20 And Noah remains a man of the ground, and plants a vineyard,
\v 21 and drinks of the wine, and is drunken, and uncovers himself in the midst of the tent.
\v 22 And Ham, father of Canaan, sees the nakedness of his father, and declares to his two brothers outside.
\v 23 And Shem takes—Japheth also—the garment, and they place on the shoulder of them both, and go backward, and cover the nakedness of their father; and their faces [are] backward, and their father’s nakedness they have not seen.
\v 24 And Noah awakens from his wine, and knows that which his young son has done to him,
\v 25 and says: “Cursed [is] Canaan, || Servant of servants he is to his brothers.”
\v 26 And he says: “Blessed of my God YHWH [is] Shem, || And Canaan is servant to him.
\v 27 God gives beauty to Japheth, || And he dwells in tents of Shem, || And Canaan is servant to him.”
\v 28 And Noah lives after the flood three hundred and fifty years;
\v 29 and all the days of Noah are nine hundred and fifty years, and he dies.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 And these [are] the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and sons are born to them after the flood.
\v 2 Sons of Japheth [are] Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
\v 3 And sons of Gomer [are] Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
\v 4 And sons of Javan [are] Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
\v 5 By these the islands of the nations have been parted in their lands, each by his tongue, by their families, in their nations.
\v 6 And sons of Ham [are] Cush, and Mitzraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
\v 7 And sons of Cush [are] Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah; and sons of Raamah [are] Sheba and Dedan.
\v 8 And Cush has begotten Nimrod;
\v 9 he has begun to be a hero in the land; he has been a hero in hunting before YHWH; therefore it is said, “As Nimrod the hero [in] hunting before YHWH.”
\v 10 And the first part of his kingdom is Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar;
\v 11 from that land he has gone out to Asshur, and builds Nineveh, even the broad places of the city, and Calah,
\v 12 and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah; it [is] the great city.
\v 13 And Mitzraim has begotten the Ludim, and the Anamim, and the Lehabim, and the Naphtuhim,
\v 14 and the Pathrusim, and the Casluhim (from where have come out Philistim), and the Caphtorim.
\v 15 And Canaan has begotten Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,
\v 16 and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,
\v 17 and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
\v 18 and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward the families of the Canaanite have been scattered.
\v 19 And the border of the Canaanite is from Sidon, [in] your coming toward Gerar, to Gaza; [in] your coming toward Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, to Lasha.
\v 20 These [are] sons of Ham, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
\v 21 As for Shem, father of all sons of Eber, the older brother of Japheth, he has also begotten.
\v 22 Sons of Shem [are] Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
\v 23 And sons of Aram [are] Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
\v 24 And Arphaxad has begotten Salah, and Salah has begotten Eber.
\v 25 And two sons have been born to Eber; the name of the first [is] Peleg (for in his days the earth has been divided), and his brother’s name [is] Joktan.
\v 26 And Joktan has begotten Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
\v 27 and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
\v 28 and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
\v 29 and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these [are] sons of Joktan;
\v 30 and their dwelling is from Mesha, [in] your coming toward Sephar, a mountain of the east.
\v 31 These [are] sons of Shem, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, by their nations.
\v 32 These [are] families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, in their nations, and by these the nations have been parted in the earth after the flood.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 And the whole earth is of one language, and of the same words,
\v 2 and it comes to pass, in their journeying from the east, that they find a valley in the land of Shinar and dwell there;
\v 3 and they each say to his neighbor, “Give help, let us make bricks, and burn [them] thoroughly”: and the brick is to them for stone, and the bitumen has been to them for mortar.
\v 4 And they say, “Give help, let us build for ourselves a city and tower with its head in the heavens, and make for ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of all the earth.”
\v 5 And YHWH comes down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men have built;
\v 6 and YHWH says, “Behold, the people [is] one, and one language [is] to them all, and this it has dreamed of doing; and now, nothing is restrained from them of that which they have purposed to do.
\v 7 Give help, let us go down there and confuse their language, so that a man will not understand the language of his companion.”
\v 8 And YHWH scatters them from there over the face of all the earth, and they cease to build the city;
\v 9 therefore [one] has called its name Babel, for there YHWH has confused the language of all the earth, and from there YHWH has scattered them over the face of all the earth.
\v 10 These [are] the generations of Shem: Shem [is] a son of one hundred years, and begets Arphaxad two years after the flood.
\v 11 And Shem lives after his begetting Arphaxad five hundred years, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 12 And Arphaxad has lived thirty-five years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* one hundred and thirty-five years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets Salah.
\v 13 And Arphaxad lives after his begetting Salah four hundred and three years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* four hundred and thirty years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 14 And Salah has lived thirty years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* one hundred and thirty years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets Eber.
\v 15 And Salah lives after his begetting Eber four hundred and three years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* three hundred and thirty years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 16 And Eber lives thirty-four years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* one hundred and thirty-four years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets Peleg.
\v 17 And Eber lives after his begetting Peleg four hundred and thirty years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* three hundred and seventy years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 18 And Peleg lives thirty years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* one hundred and thirty years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets Reu.
\v 19 And Peleg lives after his begetting Reu two hundred and nine years, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 20 And Reu lives thirty-two years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* one hundred and thirty-two years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets Serug.
\v 21 And Reu lives after his begetting Serug two hundred and seven years, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 22 And Serug lives thirty years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* one hundred and thirty years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets Nahor.
\v 23 And Serug lives after his begetting Nahor two hundred years, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 24 And Nahor lives twenty-nine years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* seventy-nine years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets Terah.
\v 25 And Nahor lives after his begetting Terah one hundred and nineteen years \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* one hundred and twenty-nine years\bd ]]\bd*, and begets sons and daughters.
\v 26 And Terah lives seventy years, and begets Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
\v 27 And these [are] the generations of Terah: Terah has begotten Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran has begotten Lot;
\v 28 and Haran dies in the presence of Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.
\v 29 And Abram and Nahor take to themselves wives; the name of Abram’s wife [is] Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife [is] Milcah, daughter of Haran, father of Milcah, and father of Iscah.
\v 30 And Sarai is barren—she has no child.
\v 31 And Terah takes his son Abram, and Lot, son of Haran, his son’s son, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, wife of his son Abram, and they go out with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go toward the land of Canaan; and they come to Haran, and dwell there.
\v 32 And the days of Terah are two hundred and five years, and Terah dies in Haran.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 And YHWH says to Abram, “Go for yourself, from your land, and from your family, and from the house of your father, to the land which I show you.
\v 2 And I make you become a great nation, and bless you, and make your name great; and be a blessing.
\v 3 And I bless those blessing you, and I curse him who is cursing you, and all families of the ground have been blessed in you.”
\v 4 And Abram goes on, as YHWH has spoken to him, and Lot goes with him, and Abram [is] a son of seventy-five years in his going out from Haran.
\v 5 And Abram takes his wife Sarai, and his brother’s son Lot, and all their substance that they have gained, and the persons that they have obtained in Haran; and they go out to go toward the land of Canaan; and they come to the land of Canaan.
\v 6 And Abram passes over into the land, to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh; and the Canaanite [is] then in the land.
\v 7 And YHWH appears to Abram and says, “To your seed I give this land”; and there he builds an altar to YHWH, who has appeared to him.
\v 8 And he removes from there toward a mountain at the east of Beth-El, and stretches out the tent (Beth-El at the west, and Hai at the east), and he builds an altar to YHWH there, and preaches in the Name of YHWH.
\v 9 And Abram journeys, going on and journeying toward the south.
\v 10 And there is a famine in the land, and Abram goes down toward Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine [is] grievous in the land;
\v 11 and it comes to pass as he has drawn near to enter Egypt, that he says to his wife Sarai, “Now behold, I have known that you [are] a woman of beautiful appearance;
\v 12 and it has come to pass that the Egyptians see you, and they have said, This [is] his wife; and they have slain me, and you they keep alive:
\v 13 please say you [are] my sister, so that it is well with me because of you, and my soul has lived for your sake.”
\v 14 And it comes to pass, at the entering of Abram into Egypt, that the Egyptians see the woman that she [is] exceedingly beautiful;
\v 15 and princes of Pharaoh see her, and praise her to Pharaoh, and the woman is taken [to] Pharaoh’s house;
\v 16 and to Abram he has done good because of her, and he has sheep and oxen, and male donkeys, and menservants, and handmaids, and female donkeys, and camels.
\v 17 And YHWH plagues Pharaoh and his house—great plagues—for the matter of Sarai, Abram’s wife.
\v 18 And Pharaoh calls for Abram and says, “What [is] this you have done to me? Why have you not declared to me that she [is] your wife?
\v 19 Why have you said, She [is] my sister, and I take her to myself for a wife? And now, behold, your wife, take and go.”
\v 20 And Pharaoh charges men concerning him, and they send him away, and his wife, and all that he has.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 And Abram goes up from Egypt (he and his wife, and all that he has, and Lot with him) toward the south;
\v 2 and Abram [is] exceedingly wealthy in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
\v 3 And he goes on his journeys from the south, even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the commencement, between Bethel and Hai—
\v 4 to the place of the altar which he made there at the first, and there Abram preaches in the Name of YHWH.
\v 5 And also to Lot, who is going with Abram, there has been sheep and oxen and tents;
\v 6 and the land has not permitted them to dwell together, for their substance has been much, and they have not been able to dwell together;
\v 7 and there is a strife between those feeding Abram’s livestock and those feeding Lot’s livestock; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite [are] then dwelling in the land.
\v 8 And Abram says to Lot, “Please let there not be strife between me and you, and between my shepherds and your shepherds, for we [are] men—brothers.
\v 9 Is not all the land before you? Please be parted from me; if to the left, then I to the right; and if to the right, then I to the left.”
\v 10 And Lot lifts up his eyes, and sees the whole circuit of the Jordan that it [is] all a watered country (before YHWH’s destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, as YHWH’s garden, as the land of Egypt), in your coming toward Zoar,
\v 11 and Lot chooses for himself the whole circuit of the Jordan; and Lot journeys from the east, and they are parted—a man from his companion;
\v 12 Abram has dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot has dwelt in the cities of the circuit, and moves [his] tent to Sodom;
\v 13 and the men of Sodom [are] evil, and sinners before YHWH exceedingly.
\v 14 And YHWH said to Abram, after Lot’s being parted from him, “Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you [are], northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward;
\v 15 for the whole of the land which you are seeing, I give it to you and to your Seed for all time.
\v 16 And I have set your seed as dust of the earth, so that, if one is able to number the dust of the earth, even your seed is numbered;
\v 17 rise, go up and down through the land, to its length, and to its breadth, for to you I give it.”
\v 18 And Abram moves [his] tent, and comes, and dwells among the oaks of Mamre, which [are] in Hebron, and builds there an altar to YHWH.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 And it comes to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations,
\v 2 they have made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which [is] Zoar.
\v 3 All these have been joined together to the Valley of Siddim, which [is] the Salt Sea;
\v 4 [for] twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and the thirteenth year they rebelled.
\v 5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings who [are] with him, and they strike the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
\v 6 and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to El-Paran, which [is] by the wilderness;
\v 7 and they turn back and come to En-Mishpat, which [is] Kadesh, and strike the whole field of the Amalekite, and also the Amorite who is dwelling in Hazezon-Tamar.
\v 8 And the king of Sodom goes out, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which [is] Zoar; and they set in array [for] battle with them in the Valley of Siddim,
\v 9 with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with the five.
\v 10 And the Valley of Siddim [is] full of bitumen-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah flee, and fall there, and those left have fled to the mountain.
\v 11 And they take the whole substance of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the whole of their food, and go away;
\v 12 and they take Lot, Abram’s brother’s son (seeing he is dwelling in Sodom), and his substance, and go away.
\v 13 And one who is escaping comes and declares to Abram the Hebrew, and he is dwelling among the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, and they [are] Abram’s allies.
\v 14 And Abram hears that his brother has been taken captive, and he draws out his trained servants, three hundred and eighteen, and pursues to Dan.
\v 15 And he divides himself against them by night, he and his servants, and strikes them, and pursues them to Hobah, which [is] at the left of Damascus;
\v 16 and he brings back the whole of the substance, and he has also brought back his brother Lot and his substance, and also the women and the people.
\v 17 And the king of Sodom goes out to meet him (after his turning back from the striking of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings who [are] with him), to the Valley of Shaveh, which [is] the king’s valley.
\v 18 And Melchizedek king of Salem has brought out bread and wine, and he [is] priest of God Most High;
\v 19 and he blesses him and says, “Blessed [is] Abram to God Most High, possessing the heavens and earth;
\v 20 and blessed [is] God Most High, who has delivered your adversaries into your hand”; and he gives to him a tenth of all.
\v 21 And the king of Sodom says to Abram, “Give to me the persons, and take the substance to yourself,”
\v 22 and Abram says to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to YHWH, God Most High, possessing the heavens and earth—
\v 23 from a thread even to a shoe-strap I do not take of anything which you have, that you do not say, I have made Abram rich;
\v 24 save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who have gone with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre—they take their portion.”
\c 15
\p
\v 1 After these things the word of YHWH has been to Abram in a vision, saying, “Do not fear, Abram, I [am] a shield to you, your reward [is] exceedingly great.”
\v 2 And Abram says, “Lord YHWH, what do You give to me, and I am going childless? And an acquired son in my house is Demmesek Eliezer.”
\v 3 And Abram says, “Behold, to me You have not given seed, and behold, a servant will be my heir.”
\v 4 And behold, the word of YHWH [is] to him, saying, “This [one] will not be your heir; but he who comes out from your bowels, he will be your heir”;
\v 5 and He brings him out outside and says, “Now look attentively toward the heavens and count the stars, if you are able to count them”; and He says to him, “Thus is your seed.”
\v 6 And he has believed in YHWH, and He reckons it to him—righteousness.
\v 7 And He says to him, “I [am] YHWH who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give to you this land to possess it”;
\v 8 and he says, “Lord YHWH, whereby do I know that I possess it?”
\v 9 And He says to him, “Take for Me a heifer of three years, and a female goat of three years, and a ram of three years, and a turtle-dove, and a young bird”;
\v 10 and he takes all these to Him, and separates them in the midst, and puts each piece opposite its fellow, but the bird he has not divided;
\v 11 and the ravenous birds come down on the carcasses, and Abram causes them to turn back.
\v 12 And the sun is about to go in, and deep sleep has fallen on Abram, and behold, a terror of great darkness is falling on him;
\v 13 and He says to Abram, “knowing—know that your seed is a sojourner in a land not theirs, and they have served them, and they have afflicted them four hundred years,
\v 14 and the nation also whom they serve I judge, and after this they go out with great substance;
\v 15 and you come to your fathers in peace; you are buried in a good old age;
\v 16 and the fourth generation turns back here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.”
\v 17 And it comes to pass—the sun has gone in, and thick darkness has been and behold, a furnace of smoke, and a lamp of fire, which has passed over between those pieces.
\v 18 In that day has YHWH made with Abram a covenant, saying, “To your seed I have given this land, from the River of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates River,
\v 19 with the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,
\v 20 and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,
\v 21 and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.”
\c 16
\p
\v 1 And Sarai, Abram’s wife, has not borne to him, and she has a handmaid, an Egyptian, and her name [is] Hagar;
\v 2 and Sarai says to Abram, “Now behold, YHWH has restrained me from bearing, please go in to my handmaid; perhaps I am built up from her”; and Abram listens to the voice of Sarai.
\v 3 And Sarai, Abram’s wife, takes Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, at the end of the tenth year of Abram’s dwelling in the land of Canaan, and gives her to her husband Abram—to him for a wife,
\v 4 and he goes in to Hagar, and she conceives, and she sees that she has conceived, and her mistress is lightly esteemed in her eyes.
\v 5 And Sarai says to Abram, “My violence [is] for you; I have given my handmaid into your bosom, and she sees that she has conceived, and I am lightly esteemed in her eyes; YHWH judges between me and you.”
\v 6 And Abram says to Sarai, “Behold, your handmaid [is] in your hand, do to her that which is good in your eyes”; and Sarai afflicted her, and she flees from her presence.
\v 7 And the Messenger of YHWH finds her by the fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way [to] Shur,
\v 8 and He says, “Hagar, Sarai’s handmaid, from where have you come, and to where do you go?” And she says, “From the presence of Sarai, my mistress, I am fleeing.”
\v 9 And the Messenger of YHWH says to her, “Return to your mistress, and humble yourself under her hands”;
\v 10 and the Messenger of YHWH says to her, “Multiplying I multiply your seed, and it is not numbered from multitude”;
\v 11 and the Messenger of YHWH says to her, “Behold you [are] conceiving, and bearing a son, and have called his name Ishmael, for YHWH has listened to your affliction;
\v 12 and he is a wild-donkey man, his hand against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him—and before the face of all his brothers he dwells.”
\v 13 And she calls the Name of YHWH who is speaking to her, “You [are], O God, my beholder”; for she said, “Even here have I looked behind my beholder?”
\v 14 Therefore has one called the well, “The well of the Living One, my beholder”; behold, between Kadesh and Bered.
\v 15 And Hagar bears a son to Abram; and Abram calls the name of his son, whom Hagar has borne, Ishmael;
\v 16 and Abram [is] a son of eighty-six years in Hagar’s bearing Ishmael to Abram.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 And Abram is a son of ninety-nine years, and YHWH appears to Abram, and says to him, “I [am] God Almighty, habitually walk before Me, and be perfect;
\v 2 and I give My covenant between Me and you, and multiply you very exceedingly.”
\v 3 And Abram falls on his face, and God speaks with him, saying,
\v 4 “I—behold, My covenant [is] with you, and you have become father of a multitude of nations;
\v 5 and your name is no longer called Abram, but your name has been Abraham, for father of a multitude of nations have I made you;
\v 6 and I have made you exceedingly fruitful, and made you become nations, and kings go out from you.
\v 7 And I have established My covenant between Me and you, and your seed after you, throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant, to become God to you, and to your seed after you;
\v 8 and I have given to you, and to your seed after you, the land of your sojournings, the whole land of Canaan, for a continuous possession, and I have become their God.”
\v 9 And God says to Abraham, “And you keep My covenant, you and your seed after you, throughout their generations;
\v 10 this [is] My covenant which you keep between Me and you, and your seed after you: every male of you [is] to be circumcised;
\v 11 and you have circumcised the flesh of your foreskin, and it has become a token of a covenant between Me and you.
\v 12 And a son of eight days is circumcised by you; every male throughout your generations, born in the house, or bought with money from any son of a stranger, who is not of your seed;
\v 13 he is certainly circumcised who [is] born in your house, or bought with your money; and My covenant has become in your flesh a perpetual covenant;
\v 14 and an uncircumcised one, a male, the flesh of whose foreskin is not circumcised, indeed, that person has been cut off from his people; My covenant he has broken.”
\v 15 And God says to Abraham, “Sarai your wife—you do not call her name Sarai, for Sarah [is] her name;
\v 16 and I have blessed her, and have also given to you a son from her; and I have blessed her, and she has become nations—kings of peoples are from her.”
\v 17 And Abraham falls on his face, and laughs, and says in his heart, “Is one born to the son of one hundred years? Or does Sarah—daughter of ninety years—bear?”
\v 18 And Abraham says to God, “O that Ishmael may live before You”;
\v 19 and God says, “Your wife Sarah is certainly bearing a son to you, and you have called his name Isaac, and I have established My covenant with him, for a perpetual covenant, to his seed after him.
\v 20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I have blessed him, and made him fruitful, and multiplied him, very exceedingly; twelve princes does he beget, and I have made him become a great nation;
\v 21 and My covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah does bear to you at this appointed time in the next year”;
\v 22 and He finishes speaking with him, and God goes up from Abraham.
\v 23 And Abraham takes his son Ishmael, and all those born in his house, and all those bought with his money—every male among the men of Abraham’s house and circumcises the flesh of their foreskin, in this very same day, as God has spoken with him.
\v 24 And Abraham [is] a son of ninety-nine years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;
\v 25 and his son Ishmael [is] a son of thirteen years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;
\v 26 in this very same day Abraham has been circumcised, and his son Ishmael;
\v 27 and all the men of his house—born in the house, and bought with money from the son of a stranger—have been circumcised with him.

\v 1 And YHWH appears to him among the oaks of Mamre, and he is sitting at the opening of the tent, about the heat of the day;
\v 2 and he lifts up his eyes and looks, and behold, three men standing by him, and he sees, and runs to meet them from the opening of the tent, and bows himself toward the earth,
\v 3 and he says, “My Lord, if now I have found grace in Your eyes, please do not pass on from Your servant;
\v 4 please let a little water be accepted, and wash Your feet, and recline under the tree;
\v 5 and I bring a piece of bread, and support Your heart; afterward pass on, for therefore You have passed over to Your servant”; and they say, “So may you do as you have spoken.”
\v 6 And Abraham hurries toward the tent, to Sarah, and says, “Hurry three measures of flour-meal, knead, and make cakes”;
\v 7 and Abraham ran to the herd, and takes a son of the herd, tender and good, and gives to the young man, and he hurries to prepare it;
\v 8 and he takes butter and milk, and the son of the herd which he has prepared, and sets before them; and he is standing by them under the tree, and they eat.
\v 9 And they say to him, “Where [is] Sarah your wife?” And he says, “Behold—in the tent”;
\v 10 and He says, “Returning I return to you, about the time of life, and behold, to Sarah your wife a son.” And Sarah is listening at the opening of the tent, which is behind him;
\v 11 and Abraham and Sarah [are] aged, entering into days—the way of women has ceased to be to Sarah;
\v 12 and Sarah laughs in her heart, saying, “After I have waxed old have I had pleasure? My lord [is] also old!”
\v 13 And YHWH says to Abraham, “Why [is] this? Sarah has laughed, saying, Is it really true—I bear—and I am aged?
\v 14 Is anything too wonderful for YHWH? At the appointed time I return to you, about the time of life, and Sarah has a son.”
\v 15 And Sarah denies, saying, “I did not laugh”; for she has been afraid; and He says, “No, but you did laugh.”
\v 16 And the men rise from there, and look on the face of Sodom, and Abraham is going with them to send them away;
\v 17 and YHWH said, “Am I concealing from Abraham that which I am doing,
\v 18 and Abraham certainly becomes a great and mighty nation, and blessed in him have been all nations of the earth?
\v 19 For I have known him, that he commands his children, and his house after him (and they have kept the way of YHWH), to do righteousness and judgment, that YHWH may bring on Abraham that which He has spoken concerning him.”
\v 20 And YHWH says, “The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah—because great; and their sin—because exceedingly grievous:
\v 21 I go down now, and see whether according to its cry which is coming to Me they have done completely—and if not—I know”;
\v 22 and the men turn from there, and go toward Sodom; and Abraham is yet standing before YHWH.
\v 23 And Abraham draws near and says, “Do You also consume righteous with wicked?
\v 24 Perhaps there are fifty righteous in the midst of the city; do You also consume, and not bear with the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who [are] in its midst?
\v 25 Far be it from You to do according to this thing, to put to death the righteous with the wicked; that it has been—as the righteous so the wicked—far be it from You; does the Judge of all the earth not do justice?”
\v 26 And YHWH says, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous in the midst of the city, then have I borne with all the place for their sake.”
\v 27 And Abraham answers and says, “Now behold, I have willed to speak to the Lord, and I [am] dust and ashes;
\v 28 perhaps there are lacking five of the fifty righteous—do You destroy for five the whole of the city?” And He says, “I do not destroy [it], if I find there forty-five.”
\v 29 And he adds again to speak to Him and says, “Perhaps there are found there forty?” And He says, “I do not do [it], because of the forty.”
\v 30 And he says, “Please let it not be displeasing to the Lord, and I speak: perhaps there are found there thirty?” And He says, “I do not do [it], if I find there thirty.”
\v 31 And he says, “Now behold, I have willed to speak to the Lord: perhaps there are found there twenty?” And He says, “I do not destroy [it], because of the twenty.”
\v 32 And he says, “Please let it not be displeasing to the Lord, and I speak only this time: perhaps there are found there ten?” And He says, “I do not destroy [it], because of the ten.”
\v 33 And YHWH goes on, when He has finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham has turned back to his place.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 And two of the messengers come toward Sodom at evening, and Lot is sitting at the gate of Sodom, and Lot sees, and rises to meet them, and bows himself—face to the earth,
\v 2 and he says, “Now behold, my lords, please turn aside to the house of your servant, and lodge, and wash your feet—then you have risen early and gone on your way”; and they say, “No, but we lodge in the broad place.”
\v 3 And he presses on them greatly, and they turn aside to him, and come into his house; and he makes a banquet for them, and has baked unleavened things; and they eat.
\v 4 Before they lie down, the men of the city—men of Sodom—have surrounded the house, from young even to aged, all the people from the extremity;
\v 5 and they call to Lot and say to him, “Where [are] the men who have come to you tonight? Bring them out to us, and we know them.”
\v 6 And Lot goes out to them, to the opening, and the door has shut behind him,
\v 7 and says, “Please, my brothers, do not do evil;
\v 8 now behold, I have two daughters who have not known anyone; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them as [is] good in your eyes; only do nothing to these men, for therefore they have come in within the shadow of my roof.”
\v 9 And they say, “Come near here”; they also say, “This one has come to sojourn, and he certainly judges! Now, we do evil to you more than [to] them”; and they press against the man, against Lot greatly, and come near to break the door.
\v 10 And the men put forth their hand, and bring in Lot to them, into the house, and have shut the door;
\v 11 and the men who [are] at the opening of the house they have struck with blindness, from small even to great, and they weary themselves to find the opening.
\v 12 And the men say to Lot, “Whom have you here still? Son-in-law, your sons also, and your daughters, and all whom you have in the city, bring out from this place;
\v 13 for we are destroying this place, for their cry has been great [before] the face of YHWH, and YHWH does send us to destroy it.”
\v 14 And Lot goes out and speaks to his sons-in-law, those taking his daughters, and says, “Rise, go out from this place, for YHWH is destroying the city”; and he is as [one] mocking in the eyes of his sons-in-law.
\v 15 And when the dawn has ascended, then the messengers press on Lot, saying, “Rise, take your wife, and your two daughters who are found present, lest you are consumed in the iniquity of the city.”
\v 16 And he lingers, and the men lay hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters, through the mercy of YHWH to him, and they bring him out, and cause him to rest outside the city.
\v 17 And it comes to pass, when he has brought them outside, that he says, “Escape for your life; do not look behind you, nor stand in all the circuit; escape to the mountain, lest you are consumed.”
\v 18 And Lot says to them, “Oh not [so], my lord;
\v 19 now behold, your servant has found grace in your eyes, and you make great your kindness which you have done with me by saving my life, and I am unable to escape to the mountain, lest the evil cleave [to] me and I have died;
\v 20 now behold, this city [is] near to flee there, and it [is] little; please let me escape there (is it not little?) that my soul may live.”
\v 21 And he says to him, “Behold, I have also accepted your face for this thing, without overthrowing the city [for] which you have spoken;
\v 22 hurry, escape there, for I am not able to do anything until your entering there”; therefore he calls the name of the city Zoar.
\v 23 The sun has gone out on the earth, and Lot has entered into Zoar,
\v 24 and YHWH has rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from YHWH, from the heavens;
\v 25 and He overthrows these cities, and all the circuit, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which is shooting up from the ground.
\v 26 And his wife looks from behind him, and she becomes a pillar of salt!
\v 27 And Abraham rises early in the morning to the place where he has stood [before] the face of YHWH;
\v 28 and he looks on the face of Sodom and Gomorrah, and on all the face of the land of the circuit, and sees, and behold, the smoke of the land went up as smoke of the furnace.
\v 29 And it comes to pass, in God’s destroying the cities of the circuit, that God remembers Abraham, and sends Lot out of the midst of the overthrow in the overthrowing of the cities in which Lot dwelt.
\v 30 And Lot goes up out of Zoar, and dwells in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he has been afraid of dwelling in Zoar, and he dwells in a cave, he and his two daughters.
\v 31 And the firstborn says to the younger, “Our father [is] old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us, as [is] the way of all the earth;
\v 32 come, we cause our father to drink wine, and lie with him, and preserve a seed from our father.”
\v 33 And they cause their father to drink wine on that night; and the firstborn goes in and lies with her father, and he has not known in her lying down or in her rising up.
\v 34 And it comes to pass, on the next day, that the firstborn says to the younger, “Behold, I have lain with my father last night: we also cause him to drink wine tonight, then go in, lie with him, and we preserve a seed from our father.”
\v 35 And they cause their father to drink wine on that night also, and the younger rises and lies with him, and he has not known in her lying down or in her rising up.
\v 36 And the two daughters of Lot conceive from their father,
\v 37 and the firstborn bears a son and calls his name Moab: he [is] father of Moab to this day.
\v 38 As for the younger, she has also born a son and calls his name Ben-Ammi: he [is] father of the sons of Ammon to this day.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 And Abraham journeys from there toward the land of the south, and dwells between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourns in Gerar;
\v 2 and Abraham says concerning his wife Sarah, “She is my sister”; and Abimelech king of Gerar sends and takes Sarah.
\v 3 And God comes to Abimelech in a dream of the night and says to him, “Behold, you [are] a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken—and she married to a husband.”
\v 4 And Abimelech has not drawn near to her, and he says, “Lord, do you also slay a righteous nation?
\v 5 Has he not himself said to me, She [is] my sister! And she, even she herself, said, He [is] my brother; in the integrity of my heart, and in the innocence of my hands, I have done this.”
\v 6 And God says to him in the dream, “Indeed, I have known that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I withhold you, even I, from sinning against Me, therefore I have not permitted you to come against her;
\v 7 and now send back the man’s wife, for he [is] inspired, and he prays for you, and you live; and if you do not send back, know that dying you die, you and all that you have.”
\v 8 And Abimelech rises early in the morning, and calls for all his servants, and speaks all these words in their ears; and the men fear exceedingly;
\v 9 and Abimelech calls for Abraham and says to him, “What have you done to us? And what have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me, and on my kingdom, a great sin? Works which are not done you have done with me.”
\v 10 Abimelech also says to Abraham, “What have you seen that you have done this thing?”
\v 11 And Abraham says, “Because I said, Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they have slain me for the sake of my wife;
\v 12 and also, she is truly my sister, daughter of my father, only not daughter of my mother, and she becomes my wife;
\v 13 and it comes to pass, when God has caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I say to her, This [is] your kindness which you do with me: at every place to where we come, say of me, He [is] my brother.”
\v 14 And Abimelech takes sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and gives to Abraham, and sends back his wife Sarah to him;
\v 15 and Abimelech says, “Behold, my land [is] before you, where it is good in your eyes, dwell”;
\v 16 and to Sarah he has said, “Behold, I have given one thousand pieces of silver to your brother; behold, it is to you a covering of eyes, to all who are with you”; and by all this she is reasoned with.
\v 17 And Abraham prays to God, and God heals Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bear:
\v 18 for YHWH restraining had restrained every womb of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 And YHWH has looked after Sarah as He has said, and YHWH does to Sarah as He has spoken;
\v 2 and Sarah conceives, and bears a son to Abraham, to his old age, at the appointed time that God has spoken of with him;
\v 3 and Abraham calls the name of his son who is born to him, whom Sarah has borne to him—Isaac;
\v 4 and Abraham circumcises his son Isaac, [being] a son of eight days, as God has commanded him.
\v 5 And Abraham [is] a son of one hundred years in his son Isaac being born to him,
\v 6 and Sarah says, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who is hearing laughs for me.”
\v 7 She also says, “Who has said to Abraham, Sarah has suckled sons, that I have born a son for his old age?”
\v 8 And the boy grows, and is weaned, and Abraham makes a great banquet in the day of Isaac’s being weaned;
\v 9 and Sarah sees the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she has borne to Abraham, mocking,
\v 10 and she says to Abraham, “Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid has no possession with my son—with Isaac.”
\v 11 And the thing is very wrong in the eyes of Abraham, for his son’s sake;
\v 12 and God says to Abraham, “Let it not be wrong in your eyes because of the youth, and because of your handmaid: all that Sarah says to you—listen to her voice, for in Isaac is a seed called to you.
\v 13 As for the son of the handmaid also, for a nation I set him, because he [is] your seed.”
\v 14 And Abraham rises early in the morning, and takes bread, and a bottle of water, and gives to Hagar (placing [it] on her shoulder), also the boy, and sends her out; and she goes on, and goes astray in the wilderness of Beer-Sheba;
\v 15 and the water is consumed from the bottle, and she places the boy under one of the shrubs.
\v 16 And she goes and sits by herself opposite [him], far off, about a bow-shot, for she said, “Do not let me look on the death of the boy”; and she sits opposite [him], and lifts up her voice, and weeps.
\v 17 And God hears the voice of the youth; and the messenger of God calls to Hagar from the heavens and says to her, “What to you, Hagar? Do not fear; for God has listened to the voice of the youth where he [is];
\v 18 rise, lift up the youth, and lay hold on him with your hand, for I set him for a great nation.”
\v 19 And God opens her eyes, and she sees a well of water, and she goes and fills the bottle [with] water, and causes the youth to drink;
\v 20 and God is with the youth, and he grows, and dwells in the wilderness, and is an archer;
\v 21 and he dwells in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother takes for him a wife from the land of Egypt.
\v 22 And it comes to pass at that time that Abimelech speaks—Phichol also, head of his host—to Abraham, saying, “God [is] with you in all that you are doing;
\v 23 and now, swear to me by God here: you do not lie to me, or to my continuator, or to my successor; according to the kindness which I have done with you—do with me, and with the land in which you have sojourned.”
\v 24 And Abraham says, “I swear.”
\v 25 And Abraham reasoned with Abimelech concerning the matter of a well of water which Abimelech’s servants have violently taken away,
\v 26 and Abimelech says, “I have not known who has done this thing, and even you did not declare to me, and I also, I have not heard except today.”
\v 27 And Abraham takes sheep and oxen, and gives to Abimelech, and they make, both of them, a covenant;
\v 28 and Abraham sets seven lambs of the flock by themselves.
\v 29 And Abimelech says to Abraham, “What [are] they—these seven lambs which you have set by themselves?”
\v 30 And he says, “For—the seven lambs you accept from my hand, so that it becomes a witness for me that I have dug this well”;
\v 31 therefore he has called that place “Beer-Sheba,” for both of them have sworn there.
\v 32 And they make a covenant in Beer-Sheba, and Abimelech rises—Phichol also, head of his host—and they return to the land of the Philistines;
\v 33 and [Abraham] plants a tamarisk in Beer-Sheba, and preaches there in the Name of YHWH, the perpetual God;
\v 34 and Abraham sojourns in the land of the Philistines many days.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 And it comes to pass after these things that God has tried Abraham and says to him, “Abraham”; and he says, “Here I [am].”
\v 2 And He says, “Now take your son, your only one, whom you have loved, even Isaac, and go for yourself to the land of Moriah, and cause him to ascend there for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains of which I speak to you.”
\v 3 And Abraham rises early in the morning, and saddles his donkey, and takes two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac, and he cleaves the wood of the burnt-offering, and rises and goes to the place of which God has spoken to him.
\v 4 On the third day—Abraham lifts up his eyes, and sees the place from afar;
\v 5 and Abraham says to his young men, “Remain by yourselves here with the donkey, and I and the youth go over there and worship, and return to you.”
\v 6 And Abraham takes the wood of the burnt-offering, and places on his son Isaac, and he takes in his hand the fire, and the knife; and they go on both of them together.
\v 7 And Isaac speaks to his father Abraham and says, “My father,” and he says, “Here I [am], my son.” And he says, “Behold, the fire and the wood, and where the lamb for a burnt-offering?”
\v 8 And Abraham says, “God provides for Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son”; and they go on both of them together.
\v 9 And they come to the place of which God has spoken to him, and there Abraham builds the altar, and arranges the wood, and binds his son Isaac, and places him on the altar above the wood;
\v 10 and Abraham puts forth his hand, and takes the knife—to slaughter his son.
\v 11 And the Messenger of YHWH calls to him from the heavens and says, “Abraham, Abraham”; and he says, “Here I [am]”;
\v 12 and He says, “Do not put forth your hand to the youth, nor do anything to him, for now I have known that you are fearing God, and have not withheld your son, your only one, from Me.”
\v 13 And Abraham lifts up his eyes, and looks, and behold, a ram behind, seized in a thicket by its horns; and Abraham goes, and takes the ram, and causes it to ascend for a burnt-offering instead of his son;
\v 14 and Abraham calls the name of that place “YHWH-Jireh,” because it is said this day in the mountain, “YHWH provides.”
\v 15 And the Messenger of YHWH calls to Abraham a second time from the heavens,
\v 16 and says, “I have sworn by Myself—a declaration of YHWH—that because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only one,
\v 17 that blessing I bless you, and multiplying I multiply your seed as stars of the heavens, and as sand which [is] on the seashore; and your Seed possesses the gate of His enemies;
\v 18 and all nations of the earth have blessed themselves in your Seed, because you have listened to My voice.”
\v 19 And Abraham turns back to his young men, and they rise and go together to Beer-Sheba; and Abraham dwells in Beer-Sheba.
\v 20 And it comes to pass after these things that it is declared to Abraham, saying, “Behold, Milcah has borne, even she, sons to your brother Nahor:
\v 21 his firstborn Huz, and his brother Buz; and Kemuel father of Aram,
\v 22 and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel;
\v 23 and Bethuel has begotten Rebekah”; Milcah has borne these eight to Nahor, Abraham’s brother;
\v 24 and his concubine, whose name [is] Reumah, she also has borne Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maachah.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 And the life of Sarah is one hundred and twenty-seven years—years of the life of Sarah;
\v 2 and Sarah dies in Kirjath-Arba, which [is] Hebron, in the land of Canaan, and Abraham goes to mourn for Sarah, and to lament her.
\v 3 And Abraham rises up from the presence of his dead, and speaks to the sons of Heth, saying,
\v 4 “A sojourner and a settler I [am] with you; give to me a possession of a burying-place with you, and I bury my dead from before me.”
\v 5 And the sons of Heth answer Abraham, saying to him,
\v 6 “Hear us, my lord; a prince of God [are] you in our midst; in the choice of our burying-places bury your dead: none of our burying-places do we withhold from you, from burying your dead.”
\v 7 And Abraham rises and bows himself to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth,
\v 8 and he speaks with them, saying, “If it is your desire to bury my dead from before me, hear me, and meet for me with Ephron, son of Zoar;
\v 9 and he gives to me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which [is] in the extremity of his field; for full money does he give it to me, in your midst, for a possession of a burying-place.”
\v 10 And Ephron is sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth, and Ephron the Hittite answers Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, of all those entering the gate of his city, saying,
\v 11 “No, my lord, hear me: the field I have given to you, and the cave that [is] in it, to you I have given it; before the eyes of the sons of my people I have given it to you—bury your dead.”
\v 12 And Abraham bows himself before the people of the land,
\v 13 and speaks to Ephron in the ears of the people of the land, saying, “Only—if you would hear me—I have given the money of the field—accept from me, and I bury my dead there.”
\v 14 And Ephron answers Abraham, saying to him,
\v 15 “My lord, hear me: the land—four hundred shekels of silver; between me and you, what [is] it? Bury your dead.”
\v 16 And Abraham listens to Ephron, and Abraham weighs to Ephron the silver which he has spoken of in the ears of the sons of Heth, four hundred silver shekels, passing with the merchant.
\v 17 And established are the field of Ephron, which [is] in Machpelah, which [is] before Mamre, the field and the cave which [is] in it, and all the trees which [are] in the field, which [are] around all its border,
\v 18 to Abraham by purchase, before the eyes of the sons of Heth, among all entering the gate of his city.
\v 19 And after this Abraham has buried his wife Sarah at the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (which [is] Hebron), in the land of Canaan;
\v 20 and established are the field, and the cave which [is] in it, to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place, from the sons of Heth.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 And Abraham [is] old, he has entered into days, and YHWH has blessed Abraham in all [things];
\v 2 and Abraham says to his servant, the eldest of his house, who is ruling over all that he has, “Please put your hand under my thigh,
\v 3 and I cause you to swear by YHWH, God of the heavens and God of the earth, that you do not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanite, in the midst of whom I am dwelling;
\v 4 but to my land and to my family you go, and have taken a wife for my son, for Isaac.”
\v 5 And the servant says to him, “It may be the woman is not willing to come after me to this land; do I at all cause your son to return to the land from where you came out?”
\v 6 And Abraham says to him, “Take heed to yourself lest you cause my son to return there;
\v 7 YHWH, God of the heavens, who has taken me from the house of my father, and from the land of my birth, and who has spoken to me, and who has sworn to me, saying, To your seed I give this land, He sends His messenger before you, and you have taken a wife for my son from there;
\v 8 and if the woman is not willing to come after you, then you have been acquitted from this my oath: only you do not cause my son to return there.”
\v 9 And the servant puts his hand under the thigh of Abraham his lord, and swears to him concerning this matter.
\v 10 And the servant takes ten camels of the camels of his lord and goes, also of all the goods of his lord in his hand, and he rises, and goes to Aram-Naharaim, to the city of Nahor;
\v 11 and he causes the camels to kneel at the outside of the city, at the well of water, at evening, at the time of the coming out of the women who draw water.
\v 12 And he says, “YHWH, God of my lord Abraham, please cause to meet before me this day—(and do kindness with my lord Abraham;
\v 13 behold, I am standing by the fountain of water, and daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water;
\v 14 and it has been, the young person to whom I say, Please incline your pitcher and I drink, and she has said, Drink, and I also water your camels)—her [whom] You have decided for Your servant, for Isaac; and by it I know that You have done kindness with my lord.”
\v 15 And it comes to pass, before he has finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah (who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, wife of Nahor, brother of Abraham) is coming out, and her pitcher on her shoulder,
\v 16 and the young person [is] of very good appearance, a virgin, and a man has not known her; and she goes down to the fountain, and fills her pitcher, and comes up.
\v 17 And the servant runs to meet her and says, “Please let me swallow a little water from your pitcher”;
\v 18 and she says, “Drink, my lord”; and she hurries, and lets down her pitcher on her hand, and gives him drink.
\v 19 And she finishes giving him drink and says, “Also for your camels I draw until they have finished drinking”;
\v 20 and she hurries, and empties her pitcher into the drinking-trough, and runs again to the well to draw, and draws for all his camels.
\v 21 And the man, wondering at her, remains silent, to know whether YHWH has made his way prosperous or not.
\v 22 And it comes to pass, when the camels have finished drinking, that the man takes a golden ring (whose weight [is] a bekah), and two bracelets for her hands (whose weight [is] ten [bekahs] of gold),
\v 23 and says, “Whose daughter [are] you? Please declare to me, is the house of your father a place for us to lodge in?”
\v 24 And she says to him, “I [am] daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she has borne to Nahor.”
\v 25 She also says to him, “Both straw and provender [are] abundant with us, also a place to lodge in.”
\v 26 And the man bows, and pays respect to YHWH,
\v 27 and says, “Blessed [is] YHWH, God of my lord Abraham, who has not left off His kindness and His truth with my lord—I [being] in the way, YHWH has led me to the house of my lord’s brothers.”
\v 28 And the young person runs, and declares to the house of her mother according to these words.
\v 29 And Rebekah has a brother, and his name [is] Laban, and Laban runs to the man who [is] outside, to the fountain;
\v 30 indeed, it comes to pass, when he sees the ring, and the bracelets on the hands of his sister, and when he hears the words of his sister Rebekah, saying, “Thus has the man spoken to me,” that he comes to the man, and behold, he is standing by the camels by the fountain.
\v 31 And he says, “Come in, O blessed one of YHWH! Why do you stand outside—and I have prepared the house and place for the camels?”
\v 32 And he brings in the man into the house, and looses the camels, and gives straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men who [are] with him:
\v 33 and sets before him to eat; but he says, “I do not eat until I have spoken my word”; and he says, “Speak.”
\v 34 And he says, “I [am] Abraham’s servant;
\v 35 and YHWH has blessed my lord exceedingly, and he is great; and He gives to him flock, and herd, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and donkeys;
\v 36 and Sarah, my lord’s wife, bears a son to my lord, after she has been aged, and he gives to him all that he has.
\v 37 And my lord causes me to swear, saying, You do not take a wife to my son from the daughters of the Canaanite, in whose land I am dwelling.
\v 38 If not—to the house of my father you go, and to my family, and you have taken a wife for my son.
\v 39 And I say to my lord, It may be the woman does not come after me;
\v 40 and he says to me, YHWH, before whom I have habitually walked, sends His messenger with you, and has prospered your way, and you have taken a wife for my son from my family, and from the house of my father;
\v 41 then you are acquitted from my oath, when you come to my family; and if they do not give [one] to you, then you have been acquitted from my oath.
\v 42 And I come to the fountain today, and I say, YHWH, God of my lord Abraham, now if You are making prosperous my way in which I am going—
\v 43 (behold, I am standing by the fountain of water), then the virgin is coming out to draw, and I have said to her, Please let me drink a little water from your pitcher,
\v 44 and she has said to me, Both drink, and I also draw for your camels—she is the woman whom YHWH has decided for my lord’s son.
\v 45 Before I finish speaking to my heart, then behold, Rebekah is coming out, and her pitcher [is] on her shoulder, and she goes down to the fountain and draws; and I say to her, Please let me drink,
\v 46 and she hurries and lets down her pitcher from off her and says, Drink, and I also water your camels; and I drink, and she has also watered the camels.
\v 47 And I ask her, and say, Whose daughter [are] you? And she says, Daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah has borne to him, and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands,
\v 48 and I bow, and pay respect before YHWH, and I bless YHWH, God of my lord Abraham, who has led me in the true way to receive the daughter of my lord’s brother for his son.
\v 49 And now, if you are dealing kindly and truly with my lord, declare to me; and if not, declare to me; and I turn to the right or to the left.”
\v 50 And Laban answers—Bethuel also—and they say, “The thing has gone out from YHWH; we are not able to speak to you bad or good;
\v 51 behold, Rebekah [is] before you, take and go, and she is a wife to your lord’s son, as YHWH has spoken.”
\v 52 And it comes to pass, when the servant of Abraham has heard their words, that he bows himself toward the earth before YHWH;
\v 53 and the servant takes out vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and gives to Rebekah; precious things also he has given to her brother and to her mother.
\v 54 And they eat and drink, he and the men who [are] with him, and lodge all night; and they rise in the morning, and he says, “Send me to my lord”;
\v 55 and her brother says—her mother also, “Let the young person abide with us a week or ten days, afterward she goes.”
\v 56 And he says to them, “Do not delay me, seeing YHWH has prospered my way; send me away, and I go to my lord”;
\v 57 and they say, “Let us call for the young person, and inquire of her mouth”;
\v 58 and they call for Rebekah, and say to her, “Do you go with this man?” And she says, “I go.”
\v 59 And they send away their sister Rebekah, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men;
\v 60 and they bless Rebekah, and say to her, “You [are] our sister; become thousands of myriads, and your seed possesses the gate of those hating it.”
\v 61 And Rebekah and her young women arise, and ride on the camels, and go after the man; and the servant takes Rebekah and goes.
\v 62 And Isaac has come in from the entrance of the Well of the Living One, my Beholder; and he is dwelling in the land of the south,
\v 63 and Isaac goes out to meditate in the field, at the turning of the evening, and he lifts up his eyes, and looks, and behold, camels are coming.
\v 64 And Rebekah lifts up her eyes, and sees Isaac, and comes down off the camel;
\v 65 and she says to the servant, “Who [is] this man who is walking in the field to meet us?” And the servant says, “It [is] my lord”; and she takes the veil, and covers herself.
\v 66 And the servant recounts to Isaac all the things that he has done,
\v 67 and Isaac brings her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he takes Rebekah, and she becomes his wife, and he loves her, and Isaac is comforted after [the death of] his mother.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 And Abraham adds and takes a wife, and her name [is] Keturah;
\v 2 and she bears to him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
\v 3 And Jokshan has begotten Sheba and Dedan; and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim;
\v 4 and the sons of Midian [are] Ephah, and Epher, and Enoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah: all these [are] sons of Keturah.
\v 5 And Abraham gives all that he has to Isaac;
\v 6 and to the sons of the concubines whom Abraham has, Abraham has given gifts, and sends them away from his son Isaac (in his being yet alive) eastward, to the east country.
\v 7 And these [are] the days of the years of the life of Abraham, which he lived, one hundred and seventy-five years;
\v 8 and Abraham expires, and dies in a good old age, aged and satisfied, and is gathered to his people.
\v 9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael bury him at the cave of Machpelah, at the field of Ephron, son of Zoar the Hittite, which [is] before Mamre—
\v 10 the field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth—there Abraham has been buried, and his wife Sarah.
\v 11 And it comes to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blesses his son Isaac; and Isaac dwells by the Well of the Living One, my Beholder.
\v 12 And these [are] the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, has borne to Abraham;
\v 13 and these [are] the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their births: firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
\v 14 and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
\v 15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
\v 16 these are sons of Ishmael, and these [are] their names, by their villages, and by their towers; twelve princes according to their peoples.
\v 17 And these [are] the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he expires, and dies, and is gathered to his people;
\v 18 and they dwell from Havilah to Shur, which [is] before Egypt, in [your] going toward Asshur; in the presence of all his brothers has he fallen.
\v 19 And these [are] the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham has begotten Isaac;
\v 20 and Isaac is a son of forty years in his taking Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, from Padan-Aram, sister of Laban the Aramean, to him for a wife.
\v 21 And Isaac makes plea to YHWH before his wife, for she [is] barren: and YHWH accepts his plea, and his wife Rebekah conceives,
\v 22 and the children struggle together within her, and she says, “If [it is] right—why [am] I thus?” And she goes to seek YHWH.
\v 23 And YHWH says to her, “Two nations [are] in your womb, and two peoples from your bowels are parted; and the [one] people is stronger than the [other] people; and the older serves the younger.”
\v 24 And her days to bear are fulfilled, and behold, twins [are] in her womb;
\v 25 and the first comes out all red as a hairy robe, and they call his name Esau;
\v 26 and afterward his brother has come out, and his hand is taking hold on Esau’s heel, and one calls his name Jacob; and Isaac [is] a son of sixty years in her bearing them.
\v 27 And the youths grew, and Esau is a man acquainted [with] hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob [is] a plain man, inhabiting tents;
\v 28 and Isaac loves Esau, for [his] game [is] in his mouth; and Rebekah is loving Jacob.
\v 29 And Jacob boils stew, and Esau comes in from the field, and he [is] weary;
\v 30 and Esau says to Jacob, “Please let me eat some of this red-red thing, for I [am] weary”; therefore [one] has called his name Edom;
\v 31 and Jacob says, “Sell your birthright to me today.”
\v 32 And Esau says, “Behold, I am going to die, and what is this to me—a birthright?”
\v 33 And Jacob says, “Swear to me today”: and he swears to him, and sells his birthright to Jacob;
\v 34 and Jacob has given bread and stew of lentils to Esau, and he eats, and drinks, and rises, and goes; and Esau despises the birthright.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 And there is a famine in the land, besides the first famine which was in the days of Abraham, and Isaac goes to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.
\v 2 And YHWH appears to him and says, “Do not go down toward Egypt, dwell in the land concerning which I speak to you,
\v 3 sojourn in this land, and I am with you, and bless you, for to you and to your seed I give all these lands, and I have established the oath which I have sworn to your father Abraham;
\v 4 and I have multiplied your seed as stars of the heavens, and I have given to your seed all these lands; and all nations of the earth have blessed themselves in your Seed;
\v 5 because that Abraham has listened to My voice, and keeps My charge, My commands, My statutes, and My laws.”
\v 6 And Isaac dwells in Gerar;
\v 7 and men of the place ask him of his wife, and he says, “She [is] my sister”: for he has been afraid to say, “My wife—lest the men of the place kill me for Rebekah, for she [is] of good appearance.”
\v 8 And it comes to pass, when the days have been prolonged to him there, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looks through the window, and sees, and behold, Isaac is playing with his wife Rebekah.
\v 9 And Abimelech calls for Isaac and says, “Behold, she [is] surely your wife; and how could you have said, She [is] my sister?” And Isaac says to him, “Because I said, Lest I die for her.”
\v 10 And Abimelech says, “What [is] this you have done to us? As a little thing one of the people had lain with your wife, and you had brought on us guilt”;
\v 11 and Abimelech commands all the people, saying, “He who comes against this man or against his wife, dying does die.”
\v 12 And Isaac sows in that land, and finds in that year a hundredfold, and YHWH blesses him;
\v 13 and the man is great, and goes on, going on and becoming great, until he has been very great,
\v 14 and he has possession of a flock, and possession of a herd, and an abundant service; and the Philistines envy him,
\v 15 and all the wells which his father’s servants dug in the days of his father Abraham, the Philistines have stopped them, and fill them with dust.
\v 16 And Abimelech says to Isaac, “Go from us; for you have become much mightier than we”;
\v 17 and Isaac goes from there, and encamps in the Valley of Gerar, and dwells there;
\v 18 and Isaac turns back, and digs the wells of water which they dug in the days of his father Abraham, which the Philistines have stopped after the death of Abraham, and he calls to them names according to the names which his father called them.
\v 19 And Isaac’s servants dig in the valley, and find there a well of living water,
\v 20 and shepherds of Gerar strive with shepherds of Isaac, saying, “The water [is] ours”; and he calls the name of the well “Strife,” because they have striven habitually with him;
\v 21 and they dig another well, and they strive also for it, and he calls its name “Hatred.”
\v 22 And he removes from there, and digs another well, and they have not striven for it, and he calls its name “Enlargements,” and says, “For—now has YHWH given enlargement to us, and we have been fruitful in the land.”
\v 23 And he goes up from there [to] Beer-Sheba,
\v 24 and YHWH appears to him during that night and says, “I [am] the God of your father Abraham, do not fear, for I [am] with you, and have blessed you, and have multiplied your seed, because of My servant Abraham”;
\v 25 and he builds there an altar, and preaches in the Name of YHWH, and stretches out there his tent, and there Isaac’s servants dig a well.
\v 26 And Abimelech has gone to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phichol head of his host;
\v 27 and Isaac says to them, “Why have you come to me, and you have hated me, and you send me away from you?”
\v 28 And they say, “We have certainly seen that YHWH has been with you, and we say, Now let there be an oath between us, between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you;
\v 29 do no evil with us, as we have not touched you, and as we have only done good with you, and send you away in peace; you [are] now blessed of YHWH.”
\v 30 And he makes a banquet for them, and they eat and drink,
\v 31 and rise early in the morning, and swear to one another, and Isaac sends them away, and they go from him in peace.
\v 32 And it comes to pass during that day that Isaac’s servants come and declare to him concerning the circumstances of the well which they have dug, and say to him, “We have found water”;
\v 33 and he calls it Shebah, [oath,] therefore the name of the city [is] Beer-Sheba, [Well of the Oath,] to this day.
\v 34 And Esau is a son of forty years, and he takes a wife, Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite,
\v 35 and they are a bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 And it comes to pass that Isaac [is] aged, and his eyes are too dim for seeing, and he calls [for] his older son Esau and says to him, “My son”; and he says to him, “Here I [am].”
\v 2 And he says, “Now behold, I have become aged, I have not known the day of my death;
\v 3 and now, please take up your instruments, your quiver, and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt provision for me,
\v 4 and make tasteful things for me, [such] as I have loved, and bring [them] to me, and I eat, so that my soul blesses you before I die.”
\v 5 And Rebekah is listening while Isaac is speaking to his son Esau; and Esau goes to the field to hunt game—to bring in;
\v 6 and Rebekah has spoken to her son Jacob, saying, “Behold, I have heard your father speaking to your brother Esau, saying,
\v 7 Bring game for me, and make tasteful things for me, and I eat, and bless you before YHWH before my death.
\v 8 And now, my son, listen to my voice, to that which I am commanding you:
\v 9 Now go to the flock, and take for me two good kids of the goats from there, and I make them tasteful things for your father, [such] as he has loved;
\v 10 and you have taken [them] to your father, and he has eaten, so that his soul blesses you before his death.”
\v 11 And Jacob says to his mother Rebekah, “Behold, my brother Esau [is] a hairy man, and I [am] a smooth man,
\v 12 it may be my father feels me, and I have been in his eyes as a deceiver, and have brought on me disapproval, and not a blessing”;
\v 13 and his mother says to him, “On me your disapproval, my son; only listen to my voice, and go, take for me.”
\v 14 And he goes, and takes, and brings to his mother, and his mother makes tasteful things, [such] as his father has loved;
\v 15 and Rebekah takes the desirable garments of Esau her older son, which [are] with her in the house, and puts them on Jacob her younger son;
\v 16 and she has put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck,
\v 17 and she gives the tasteful things, and the bread which she has made, into the hand of her son Jacob.
\v 18 And he comes to his father and says, “My father”; and he says, “Here I [am]; who [are] you, my son?”
\v 19 And Jacob says to his father, “I [am] Esau your firstborn; I have done as you have spoken to me; please rise, sit and eat of my game, so that your soul blesses me.”
\v 20 And Isaac says to his son, “What [is] this you have hurried to find, my son?” And he says, “That which your God YHWH has caused to come before me.”
\v 21 And Isaac says to Jacob, “Please come near, and I feel you, my son, whether you [are] he, my son Esau, or not.”
\v 22 And Jacob comes near to his father Isaac, and he feels him, and says, “The voice [is] the voice of Jacob, and the hands hands of Esau.”
\v 23 And he has not discerned him, for his hands have been hairy, as the hands of his brother Esau, and he blesses him,
\v 24 and says, “You are he—my son Esau?” And he says, “I [am].”
\v 25 And he says, “Bring [it] near to me, and I eat of my son’s game, so that my soul blesses you”; and he brings [it] near to him, and he eats; and he brings wine to him, and he drinks.
\v 26 And his father Isaac says to him, “Please come near and kiss me, my son”;
\v 27 and he comes near, and kisses him, and he smells the fragrance of his garments, and blesses him, and says, “See, the fragrance of my son [is] as the fragrance of a field which YHWH has blessed;
\v 28 and God gives to you of the dew of the heavens, and of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of grain and wine;
\v 29 peoples serve you, and nations bow themselves to you, be mighty over your brothers, and the sons of your mother bow themselves to you; those who curse you [are] cursed, and those who bless you [are] blessed.”
\v 30 And it comes to pass, as Isaac has finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob is only just going out from the presence of his father Isaac, that his brother Esau has come in from his hunting;
\v 31 and he also makes tasteful things, and brings to his father, and says to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s game, so that your soul blesses me.”
\v 32 And his father Isaac says to him, “Who [are] you?” And he says, “I [am] your son, your firstborn, Esau”;
\v 33 and Isaac trembles a very great trembling and says, “Who, now, [is] he who has provided game, and brings to me, and I eat of all before you come in, and I bless him? Indeed, he is blessed.”
\v 34 When Esau hears the words of his father, then he cries a very great and bitter cry, and says to his father, “Bless me, me also, O my father”;
\v 35 and he says, “Your brother has come with subtlety, and takes your blessing.”
\v 36 And he says, “Is it because he whose name is called Jacob takes me by the heel these two times? He has taken my birthright; and behold, now he has taken my blessing”; he also says, “Have you not kept back a blessing for me?”
\v 37 And Isaac answers and says to Esau, “Behold, a mighty one have I set him over you, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants, and [with] grain and wine have I sustained him; and for you now, what will I do, my son?”
\v 38 And Esau says to his father, “One blessing have you my father? Bless me, me also, O my father”; and Esau lifts up his voice, and weeps.
\v 39 And his father Isaac answers and says to him, “Behold, of the fatness of the earth is your dwelling, and of the dew of the heavens from above;
\v 40 and by your sword you live, and your brother serves you; and it has come to pass, when you rule, that you have broken his yoke from off your neck.”
\v 41 And Esau hates Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau says in his heart, “The days of mourning [for] my father draw near, and I slay my brother Jacob.”
\v 42 And the words of Esau her older son are declared to Rebekah, and she sends and calls for Jacob her younger son, and says to him, “Behold, your brother Esau is comforting himself in regard to you—to slay you;
\v 43 and now, my son, listen to my voice, and rise, flee for yourself to my brother Laban, to Haran,
\v 44 and you have dwelt with him some days, until your brother’s fury turns back,
\v 45 until your brother’s anger turns back from you, and he has forgotten that which you have done to him, and I have sent and taken you from there; why am I bereaved even of you both the same day?”
\v 46 And Rebekah says to Isaac, “I have been disgusted with my life because of the presence of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these—from the daughters of the land—why do I live?”
\c 28
\p
\v 1 And Isaac calls to Jacob, and blesses him, and commands him, and says to him, “You must not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
\v 2 rise, go to Padan-Aram, to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel, and take for yourself a wife from there, from the daughters of your mother’s brother Laban;
\v 3 and God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and you have become an assembly of peoples;
\v 4 and He gives to you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed with you, to cause you to possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.”
\v 5 And Isaac sends Jacob away, and he goes to Padan-Aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, brother of Rebekah, mother of Jacob and Esau.
\v 6 And Esau sees that Isaac has blessed Jacob, and has sent him to Padan-Aram to take to himself from there a wife—in his blessing him that he lays a charge on him, saying, You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan—
\v 7 that Jacob listens to his father and to his mother, and goes to Padan-Aram—
\v 8 and Esau sees that the daughters of Canaan are evil in the eyes of his father Isaac,
\v 9 and Esau goes to Ishmael, and takes Mahalath, daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, sister of Nebajoth, to his wives, to himself, for a wife.
\v 10 And Jacob goes out from Beer-Sheba, and goes toward Haran,
\v 11 and he touches at a [certain] place, and lodges there, for the sun has gone in, and he takes of the stones of the place, and makes [them] his pillows, and lies down in that place.
\v 12 And he dreams, and behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and its head is touching the heavens; and behold, messengers of God are going up and coming down by it;
\v 13 and behold, YHWH is standing on it, and He says, “I [am] YHWH, God of your father Abraham, and God of Isaac; the land on which you are lying, to you I give it, and to your seed;
\v 14 and your seed has been as the dust of the land, and you have broken forth westward, and eastward, and northward, and southward, and all families of the ground have been blessed in you and in your seed.
\v 15 And behold, I [am] with you, and have kept you wherever you go, and have caused you to return to this ground; for I do not leave you until I have surely done that which I have spoken to you.”
\v 16 And Jacob awakens out of his sleep and says, “Surely YHWH is in this place, and I did not know”;
\v 17 and he fears and says, “How fearful [is] this place; this is nothing but a house of God, and this a gate of the heavens.”
\v 18 And Jacob rises early in the morning, and takes the stone which he has made his pillows, and makes it a standing pillar, and pours oil on its top,
\v 19 and he calls the name of that place Bethel, [house of God,] and yet, Luz [is] the name of the city at the first.
\v 20 And Jacob vows a vow, saying, “Seeing God is with me, and has kept me in this way which I am going, and has given to me bread to eat, and a garment to put on—
\v 21 when I have turned back in peace to the house of my father, and YHWH has become my God,
\v 22 then this stone which I have made a standing pillar is a house of God, and all that You give to me—tithing I tithe to You.”
\c 29
\p
\v 1 And Jacob lifts up his feet, and goes toward the land of the sons of the east;
\v 2 and he looks, and behold, a well in the field, and behold, there [are] three droves of a flock crouching by it, for they water the droves from that well, and the great stone [is] on the mouth of the well.
\v 3 (When all the droves have been gathered there, and they have rolled the stone from off the mouth of the well, and have watered the flock, then they have turned back the stone on the mouth of the well to its place.)
\v 4 And Jacob says to them, “My brothers, where [are] you from?” And they say, “We [are] from Haran.”
\v 5 And he says to them, “Have you known Laban, son of Nahor?” And they say, “We have known.”
\v 6 And he says to them, “Does he have peace?” And they say, “Peace; and behold, his daughter Rachel is coming with the flock.”
\v 7 And he says, “Behold, the day [is] still great, [it is] not time for the livestock to be gathered; water the flock, and go, delight yourselves.”
\v 8 And they say, “We are not able, until all the droves be gathered together, and they have rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and we have watered the flock.”
\v 9 He is yet speaking with them, and Rachel has come with the flock which her father has, for she [is] shepherdess;
\v 10 and it comes to pass, when Jacob has seen Rachel, daughter of his mother’s brother Laban, and the flock of his mother’s brother Laban, that Jacob comes near and rolls the stone from off the mouth of the well, and waters the flock of his mother’s brother Laban.
\v 11 And Jacob kisses Rachel, and lifts up his voice, and weeps,
\v 12 and Jacob declares to Rachel that he [is] her father’s brother, and that he [is] Rebekah’s son, and she runs and declares [it] to her father.
\v 13 And it comes to pass, when Laban hears the report of his sister’s son Jacob, that he runs to meet him, and embraces him, and kisses him, and brings him into his house; and he recounts to Laban all these things,
\v 14 and Laban says to him, “You [are] surely my bone and my flesh”; and he dwells with him a month of days.
\v 15 And Laban says to Jacob, “Is it because you [are] my brother that you have served me for nothing? Declare to me what your hire [is].”
\v 16 And Laban has two daughters, the name of the older [is] Leah, and the name of the younger Rachel,
\v 17 and the eyes of Leah [are] tender, and Rachel has been beautiful of form and beautiful of appearance.
\v 18 And Jacob loves Rachel and says, “I serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter”:
\v 19 and Laban says, “It is better for me to give her to you than to give her to another man; dwell with me”;
\v 20 and Jacob serves for Rachel seven years; and they are in his eyes as some days, because of his loving her.
\v 21 And Jacob says to Laban, “Give up my wife, for my days have been fulfilled, and I go in to her”;
\v 22 and Laban gathers all the men of the place, and makes a banquet.
\v 23 And it comes to pass in the evening, that he takes his daughter Leah, and brings her to him, and he goes in to her;
\v 24 and Laban gives his maidservant Zilpah to her, to his daughter Leah, [for] a maidservant.
\v 25 And it comes to pass in the morning, that behold, it [is] Leah; and he says to Laban, “What [is] this you have done to me? Have I not served with you for Rachel? And why have you deceived me?”
\v 26 And Laban says, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn;
\v 27 fulfill the period of seven [for] this one, and we also give to you this one, for the service which you serve with me yet seven other years.”
\v 28 And Jacob does so, and fulfills the period of seven [for] this one, and he gives his daughter Rachel to him for a wife for him;
\v 29 and Laban gives his maidservant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel for a maidservant for her.
\v 30 And he also goes in to Rachel, and he also loves Rachel more than Leah; and he serves with him yet seven other years.
\v 31 And YHWH sees that Leah [is] the hated one, and He opens her womb, and Rachel [is] barren;
\v 32 and Leah conceives, and bears a son, and calls his name Reuben, for she said, “Because YHWH has looked on my affliction; because now does my husband love me.”
\v 33 And she conceives again, and bears a son, and says, “Because YHWH has heard that I [am] the hated one, He also gives to me even this [one]”; and she calls his name Simeon.
\v 34 And she conceives again and bears a son, and says, “Now [is] the time, my husband is joined to me, because I have born to him three sons,” therefore has [one] called his name Levi.
\v 35 And she conceives again and bears a son, and this time says, “I praise YHWH”; therefore has she called his name Judah; and she ceases from bearing.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 And Rachel sees that she has not borne to Jacob, and Rachel is envious of her sister, and says to Jacob, “Give me sons, and if there is none—I die.”
\v 2 And Jacob’s anger burns against Rachel, and he says, “Am I in stead of God who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”
\v 3 And she says, “Behold, my handmaid Bilhah, go in to her, and she bears on my knees, and I am built up, even I, from her”;
\v 4 and she gives Bilhah her maidservant to him for a wife, and Jacob goes in to her;
\v 5 and Bilhah conceives, and bears a son to Jacob,
\v 6 and Rachel says, “God has decided for me, and has also listened to my voice, and gives a son to me”; therefore she has called his name Dan.
\v 7 And Bilhah, Rachel’s maidservant, conceives again, and bears a second son to Jacob,
\v 8 and Rachel says, “With wrestlings of God I have wrestled with my sister, indeed, I have prevailed”; and she calls his name Napthali.
\v 9 And Leah sees that she has ceased from bearing, and she takes Zilpah her maidservant, and gives her to Jacob for a wife;
\v 10 and Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, bears a son to Jacob,
\v 11 and Leah says, “A troop is coming”; and she calls his name Gad.
\v 12 And Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, bears a second son to Jacob,
\v 13 and Leah says, “Because of my happiness, for daughters have pronounced me blessed”; and she calls his name Asher.
\v 14 And Reuben goes in the days of wheat-harvest, and finds love-apples in the field, and brings them to his mother Leah, and Rachel says to Leah, “Please give to me of the love-apples of your son.”
\v 15 And she says to her, “Is your taking my husband a little thing, that you have also taken the love-apples of my son?” And Rachel says, “He therefore lies with you tonight, for your son’s love-apples.”
\v 16 And Jacob comes in from the field at evening; and Leah goes to meet him and says, “You come in to me, for [in] hiring I have hired you with my son’s love-apples”; and he lies with her during that night.
\v 17 And God listens to Leah, and she conceives, and bears a son to Jacob, a fifth,
\v 18 and Leah says, “God has given my hire, because I have given my maidservant to my husband”; and she calls his name Issachar.
\v 19 And Leah conceives again, and she bears a sixth son to Jacob,
\v 20 and Leah says, “God has endowed me—a good dowry; this time my husband dwells with me, for I have borne six sons to him”; and she calls his name Zebulun;
\v 21 and afterward she has borne a daughter, and calls her name Dinah.
\v 22 And God remembers Rachel, and God listens to her, and opens her womb,
\v 23 and she conceives and bears a son, and says, “God has gathered up my reproach”;
\v 24 and she calls his name Joseph, saying, “YHWH is adding to me another son.”
\v 25 And it comes to pass, when Rachel has borne Joseph, that Jacob says to Laban, “Send me away, and I go to my place, and to my land;
\v 26 give up my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and I go; for you have known my service which I have served you.”
\v 27 And Laban says to him, “Now if I have found grace in your eyes—I have observed diligently that YHWH blesses me for your sake.”
\v 28 He also says, “Define your hire to me, and I give.”
\v 29 And he says to him, “You have known that which I have served you [in], and that which your substance was with me;
\v 30 for [it is] little which you have had at my appearance, and it breaks forth into a multitude, and YHWH blesses you at my coming; and now, when do I make, I also, for my own house?”
\v 31 And he says, “What do I give to you?” And Jacob says, “You do not give me anything; if you do this thing for me, I turn back; I have delight; I watch your flock;
\v 32 I pass through all your flock today to turn aside every speckled and spotted sheep from there, and every brown sheep among the lambs, and speckled and spotted among the goats—and it has been my hire;
\v 33 and my righteousness has answered for me in the day to come, when it comes in for my hire before your face—everyone which is not speckled and spotted among [my] goats, and brown among [my] lambs—it is stolen with me.”
\v 34 And Laban says, “Behold, O that it were according to your word”;
\v 35 and he turns aside during that day the striped and the spotted male goats, and all the speckled and the spotted female goats, everyone that [has] white in it, and every brown one among the lambs, and he gives into the hand of his sons,
\v 36 and sets a journey of three days between himself and Jacob; and Jacob is feeding the rest of the flock of Laban.
\v 37 And Jacob takes to himself a rod of fresh poplar and almond and plane-tree, and peels in them white peelings, making bare the white that [is] on the rods,
\v 38 and sets up the rods which he has peeled in the gutters in the watering troughs (where the flock comes to drink), in front of the flock, that they may conceive in their coming to drink;
\v 39 and the flocks conceive at the rods, and the flock bears striped, speckled, and spotted ones.
\v 40 And Jacob has parted the lambs, and he puts the face of the flock toward the striped, also all the brown in the flock of Laban, and he sets his own droves by themselves, and has not set them near Laban’s flock.
\v 41 And it has come to pass, whenever the strong ones of the flock conceive, that Jacob sets the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, to cause them to conceive by the rods,
\v 42 and when the flock is feeble, he does not set [them]; and the feeble ones have been Laban’s, and the strong ones Jacob’s.
\v 43 And the man increases very exceedingly, and has many flocks, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and donkeys.
\c 31
\p
\v 1 And he hears the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken all that our father has; indeed, from that which our father has, he has made all this glory”;
\v 2 and Jacob sees the face of Laban, and behold, it is not with him as before.
\v 3 And YHWH says to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers, and to your family, and I am with you.”
\v 4 And Jacob sends and calls for Rachel and for Leah to the field to his flock;
\v 5 and says to them, “I am beholding your father’s face—that it is not toward me as before, and the God of my father has been with me,
\v 6 and you have known that with all my power I have served your father,
\v 7 and your father has played on me, and has changed my hire ten times; and God has not permitted him to do evil with me.
\v 8 If he says thus: The speckled are your hire, then all the flock bore speckled ones; and if he says thus: The striped are your hire, then all the flock bore striped;
\v 9 and God takes away the substance of your father, and gives to me.
\v 10 And it comes to pass at the time of the flock conceiving, that I lift up my eyes and see in a dream, and behold, the male goats, which are going up on the flock, [are] striped, speckled, and spotted;
\v 11 and the Messenger of God says to me in the dream, Jacob, and I say, Here I [am].
\v 12 And He says, Now lift up your eyes and see [that] all the male goats which are going up on the flock [are] striped, speckled, and spotted, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you;
\v 13 I [am] the God of Bethel where you have anointed a standing pillar, where you have vowed a vow to me; now, arise, go out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.”
\v 14 And Rachel answers—Leah also—and says to him, “Have we yet a portion and inheritance in the house of our father?
\v 15 Have we not been reckoned strangers to him? For he has sold us, and he also utterly consumes our money;
\v 16 for all the wealth which God has taken away from our father, it [is] ours, and our children’s; and now, all that God has said to you—do.”
\v 17 And Jacob rises, and lifts up his sons and his wives on the camels,
\v 18 and leads all his livestock, and all his substance which he has acquired, the livestock of his getting, which he has acquired in Padan-Aram, to go to his father Isaac, to the land of Canaan.
\v 19 And Laban has gone to shear his flock, and Rachel steals the teraphim which her father has;
\v 20 and Jacob deceives the heart of Laban the Aramean, because he has not declared to him that he is fleeing;
\v 21 and he flees, he and all that he has, and rises, and passes over the River, and sets his face [toward] the Mount of Gilead.
\v 22 And it is told to Laban on the third day that Jacob has fled,
\v 23 and he takes his brothers with him, and pursues after him a journey of seven days, and overtakes him in the Mount of Gilead.
\v 24 And God comes to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night and says to him, “Take heed to yourself lest you speak with Jacob from good to evil.”
\v 25 And Laban overtakes Jacob; and Jacob has fixed his tent in the mountain; and Laban with his brothers have fixed [theirs] in the Mount of Gilead.
\v 26 And Laban says to Jacob, “What have you done that you deceive my heart, and lead away my daughters as captives of the sword?
\v 27 Why have you hidden yourself to flee, and deceive me, and have not declared to me, and I send you away with joy and with songs, with tambourine and with harp,
\v 28 and have not permitted me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now you have acted foolishly in doing [so];
\v 29 my hand is to God to do evil with you, but the God of your father last night has spoken to me, saying, Take heed to yourself from speaking with Jacob from good to evil.
\v 30 And now, you have certainly gone, because you have been very desirous for the house of your father; why have you stolen my gods?”
\v 31 And Jacob answers and says to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, Lest you violently take away your daughters from me;
\v 32 with whomsoever you find your gods—he must not live; before our brothers discern for yourself what [is] with me, and take to yourself”: and Jacob has not known that Rachel has stolen them.
\v 33 And Laban goes into the tent of Jacob, and into the tent of Leah, and into the tent of the two handmaidens, and has not found; and he goes out from the tent of Leah, and goes into the tent of Rachel.
\v 34 And Rachel has taken the teraphim, and puts them in the furniture of the camel, and sits on them; and Laban feels all the tent, and has not found;
\v 35 and she says to her father, “Let it not be displeasing in the eyes of my lord that I am not able to rise at your presence, for the way of women [is] on me”; and he searches, and has not found the teraphim.
\v 36 And it is displeasing to Jacob, and he strives with Laban; and Jacob answers and says to Laban, “What [is] my transgression? What my sin, that you have burned after me?
\v 37 For you have felt all my vessels: what have you found of all the vessels of your house? Set here before my brothers, and your brothers, and they decide between us both.
\v 38 These twenty years I [am] with you: your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and the rams of your flock I have not eaten;
\v 39 the torn I have not brought to you—I repay it—from my hand you seek it; I have been deceived by day, and I have been deceived by night;
\v 40 I have been [thus]: drought has consumed me in the day, and frost by night, and my sleep wanders from my eyes.
\v 41 This [is] to me twenty years in your house: I have served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock; and you change my hire ten times;
\v 42 unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been for me, surely now you had sent me away empty; God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and reproves last night.”
\v 43 And Laban answers and says to Jacob, “The daughters [are] my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the flock my flock, and all that you are seeing [is] mine; and to my daughters—what do I to these today, or to their sons whom they have born?
\v 44 And now, come, let us make a covenant, I and you, and it has been for a witness between me and you.”
\v 45 And Jacob takes a stone, and lifts it up [for] a standing pillar;
\v 46 and Jacob says to his brothers, “Gather stones,” and they take stones, and make a heap; and they eat there on the heap;
\v 47 and Laban calls it Jegar-Sahadutha; and Jacob has called it Galeed.
\v 48 And Laban says, “This heap [is] witness between me and you today”; therefore has he called its name Galeed;
\v 49 Mizpah also, for he said, “YHWH watches between me and you, for we are hidden from one another;
\v 50 if you afflict my daughters, or take wives beside my daughters—there is no man with us—see, God [is] witness between me and you.”
\v 51 And Laban says to Jacob, “Behold, this heap, and behold, the standing pillar which I have cast between me and you;
\v 52 this heap [is] witness, and the standing pillar [is] witness, that I do not pass over this heap to you, and that you do not pass over this heap and this standing pillar to me—for evil;
\v 53 the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, judges between us—the God of their father,” and Jacob swears by the Fear of his father Isaac.
\v 54 And Jacob sacrifices a sacrifice on the mountain, and calls to his brothers to eat bread, and they eat bread, and lodge on the mountain;
\v 55 and Laban rises early in the morning, and kisses his sons and his daughters, and blesses them; and Laban goes on, and turns back to his place.
\c 32
\p
\v 1 And Jacob has gone on his way, and messengers of God come on him;
\v 2 and Jacob says, when he has seen them, “This [is] the camp of God”; and he calls the name of that place “Two Camps.”
\v 3 And Jacob sends messengers before him to his brother Esau, toward the land of Seir, the field of Edom,
\v 4 and commands them, saying, “Thus you say to my lord, to Esau, Thus said your servant Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and I linger until now;
\v 5 and I have ox, and donkey, flock, and manservant, and maidservant, and I send to declare to my lord, to find grace in his eyes.”
\v 6 And the messengers return to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother, to Esau, and he is also coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him”;
\v 7 and Jacob fears exceedingly, and is distressed, and he divides the people who [are] with him, and the flock, and the herd, and the camels, into two camps,
\v 8 and says, “If Esau comes to one camp, and has struck it—then the camp which is left has been for an escape.”
\v 9 And Jacob says, “God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, YHWH who says to me, Return to your land and to your family, and I do good with you:
\v 10 I have been unworthy of all the kind acts and of all the truth which You have done with your servant—for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
\v 11 Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I am fearing him, lest he come and has struck me—mother beside sons;
\v 12 and You have said, I certainly do good with you, and have set your seed as the sand of the sea, which is not numbered because of the multitude.”
\v 13 And he lodges there during that night, and takes from that which is coming into his hand, a present for his brother Esau:
\v 14 female goats two hundred, and male goats twenty, ewes two hundred, and rams twenty,
\v 15 suckling camels and their young ones thirty, cows forty, and bullocks ten, female donkeys twenty, and foals ten;
\v 16 and he gives into the hand of his servants every drove by itself, and says to his servants, “Pass over before me, and a space you put between drove and drove.”
\v 17 And he commands the first, saying, “When my brother Esau meets you, and has asked you, saying, Whose [are] you? And to where do you go? And whose [are] these before you?
\v 18 Then you have said, Your servant Jacob’s: it [is] a present sent to my lord, to Esau; and behold, he also [is] behind us.”
\v 19 And he commands also the second, also the third, also all who are going after the droves, saying, “According to this manner do you speak to Esau in your finding him,
\v 20 and you have also said, Behold, your servant Jacob [is] behind us”; for he said, “I pacify his face with the present which is going before me, and afterward I see his face; it may be he lifts up my face”;
\v 21 and the present passes over before his face, and he has lodged during that night in the camp.
\v 22 And he rises in that night, and takes his two wives, and his two maidservants, and his eleven children, and passes over the passage of Jabbok;
\v 23 and he takes them, and causes them to pass over the brook, and he causes that which he has to pass over.
\v 24 And Jacob is left alone, and One wrestles with him until the ascending of the dawn;
\v 25 and He sees that He is not able for him, and He comes against the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh is disjointed in his wrestling with Him;
\v 26 and He says, “Send Me away, for the dawn has ascended”: and he says, “I do not send You away, except You have blessed me.”
\v 27 And He says to him, “What [is] your name?” And he says, “Jacob.”
\v 28 And He says, “Your name is no longer called Jacob, but Israel; for you have reigned with God and with men, and prevail.”
\v 29 And Jacob asks and says, “Please declare Your Name”; and He says, “Why [is] this, you ask for My Name?” And He blesses him there.
\v 30 And Jacob calls the name of the place Peniel: “For I have seen God face to face, and my life is delivered”;
\v 31 and the sun rises on him when he has passed over Penuel, and he is halting on his thigh;
\v 32 therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew which shrank, which [is] on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because He came against the hollow of Jacob’s thigh, against the sinew which shrank.
\c 33
\p
\v 1 And Jacob lifts up his eyes, and looks, and behold, Esau is coming, and with him four hundred men; and he divides the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two maidservants;
\v 2 and he sets the maidservants and their children first, and Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last.
\v 3 And he himself passed over before them, and bows himself to the earth seven times, until his drawing near to his brother,
\v 4 and Esau runs to meet him, and embraces him, and falls on his neck, and kisses him, and they weep;
\v 5 and he lifts up his eyes, and sees the women and the children, and says, “What [are] these to you?” And he says, “The children with whom God has favored your servant.”
\v 6 And the maidservants draw near, they and their children, and bow themselves;
\v 7 and Leah also draws near, and her children, and they bow themselves; and afterward Joseph has drawn near with Rachel, and they bow themselves.
\v 8 And he says, “What to you [is] all this camp which I have met?” And he says, “To find grace in the eyes of my lord.”
\v 9 And Esau says, “I have abundance, my brother, that which you have, let it be for yourself.”
\v 10 And Jacob says, “No, please, now if I have found grace in your eyes, then you have received my present from my hand, because that I have seen your face, as the seeing of the face of God, and you are pleased with me;
\v 11 please receive my blessing which is brought to you, because God has favored me, and because I have all [things]”; and he presses on him, and he receives [it],
\v 12 and says, “Let us journey and go on, and I go on before you.”
\v 13 And he says to him, “My lord knows that the children [are] tender, and the suckling flock and the herd [are] with me; when they have beaten them one day, then all the flock has died.
\v 14 Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I lead on gently, according to the foot of the work which [is] before me, and to the foot of the children, until I come to my lord, to Seir.”
\v 15 And Esau says, “Please let me place with you some of the people who [are] with me”; and he said, “Why [is] this? I find grace in the eyes of my lord.”
\v 16 And Esau turns back on that day on his way to Seir;
\v 17 and Jacob has journeyed to Succoth, and builds a house for himself, and has made shelters for his livestock, therefore he has called the name of the place Succoth.
\v 18 And Jacob comes safe [to the] city of Shechem, which [is] in the land of Canaan, in his coming from Padan-Aram, and encamps before the city,
\v 19 and he buys the portion of the field where he has stretched out his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for one hundred kesitah;
\v 20 and he sets up there an altar, and proclaims at it God—the God of Israel.
\c 34
\p
\v 1 And Dinah, daughter of Leah, whom she has borne to Jacob, goes out to look on the daughters of the land,
\v 2 and Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, a prince of the land, sees her, and takes her, and lies with her, and humbles her;
\v 3 and his soul cleaves to Dinah, daughter of Jacob, and he loves the young person, and speaks to the heart of the young person.
\v 4 And Shechem speaks to his father Hamor, saying, “Take for me this girl for a wife.”
\v 5 And Jacob has heard that he has defiled his daughter Dinah, and his sons were with his livestock in the field, and Jacob kept silent until their coming.
\v 6 And Hamor, father of Shechem, goes out to Jacob to speak with him;
\v 7 and the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard, and the men grieve themselves, and it [is] very displeasing to them, for folly he has done against Israel, to lie with the daughter of Jacob—and so it is not done.
\v 8 And Hamor speaks with them, saying, “Shechem, my son, his soul has cleaved to your daughter; please give her to him for a wife,
\v 9 and join in marriage with us; you give your daughters to us, and you take our daughters for yourselves,
\v 10 and you dwell with us, and the land is before you; dwell and trade [in] it, and have possessions in it.”
\v 11 And Shechem says to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find grace in your eyes, and that which you say to me, I give;
\v 12 multiply on me dowry and gift exceedingly, and I give as you say to me, and give to me the young person for a wife.”
\v 13 And the sons of Jacob answer Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, and they speak (because he defiled their sister Dinah),
\v 14 and say to them, “We are not able to do this thing, to give our sister to one who has a foreskin, for it [is] a reproach to us.
\v 15 Only for this we consent to you: if you are as we, to have every male of you circumcised,
\v 16 then we have given our daughters to you, and we take your daughters for ourselves, and we have dwelt with you, and have become one people;
\v 17 and if you do not listen to us to be circumcised, then we have taken our daughter, and have gone.”
\v 18 And their words are good in the eyes of Hamor, and in the eyes of Shechem, Hamor’s son;
\v 19 and the young man did not delay to do the thing, for he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he is honorable above all the house of his father.
\v 20 And Hamor comes—his son Shechem also—to the gate of their city, and they speak to the men of their city, saying,
\v 21 “These men are peaceable with us; then let them dwell in the land, and trade [in] it; and the land, behold, [is] wide before them; their daughters let us take to ourselves for wives, and our daughters give to them.
\v 22 Only for this do the men consent to us, to dwell with us, to become one people, in every male of us being circumcised, as they are circumcised;
\v 23 their livestock, and their substance, and all their beasts—are they not ours? Only let us consent to them, and they dwell with us.”
\v 24 And to Hamor, and to his son Shechem, do all those going out of the gate of his city listen, and every male is circumcised, all those going out of the gate of his city.
\v 25 And it comes to pass, on the third day, in their being pained, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, take each his sword, and come in against the city confidently, and slay every male;
\v 26 and Hamor, and his son Shechem, they have slain by the mouth of the sword, and they take Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and go out.
\v 27 Jacob’s sons have come in on the wounded, and they spoil the city, because they had defiled their sister;
\v 28 their flock and their herd, and their donkeys, and that which [is] in the city, and that which [is] in the field, have they taken;
\v 29 and all their wealth, and all their infants, and their wives they have taken captive, and they spoil also all that [is] in the house.
\v 30 And Jacob says to Simeon and to Levi, “You have troubled me, by causing me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanite, and among the Perizzite: and I [am] few in number, and they have been gathered against me, and have struck me, and I have been destroyed, I and my house.”
\v 31 And they say, “Does he make our sister as a harlot?”
\c 35
\p
\v 1 And God says to Jacob, “Rise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar to God, who appeared to you in your fleeing from the face of your brother Esau.”
\v 2 And Jacob says to his household, and to all who [are] with him, “Turn aside the gods of the stranger which [are] in your midst, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments;
\v 3 and we rise, and go up to Bethel, and I make there an altar to God, who is answering me in the day of my tribulation, and is with me in the way that I have gone.”
\v 4 And they give to Jacob all the gods of the stranger that [are] in their hand, and the rings that [are] in their ears, and Jacob hides them under the oak which [is] by Shechem;
\v 5 and they journey, and the terror of God is on the cities which [are] around them, and they have not pursued after the sons of Jacob.
\v 6 And Jacob comes to Luz which [is] in the land of Canaan (it [is] Bethel), he and all the people who [are] with him,
\v 7 and he builds there an altar, and proclaims at the place the God of Bethel: for there had God been revealed to him, in his fleeing from the face of his brother.
\v 8 And Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, dies, and she is buried at the lower part of Bethel, under the oak, and he calls its name “Oak of Weeping.”
\v 9 And God appears to Jacob again, in his coming from Padan-Aram, and blesses him;
\v 10 and God says to him, “Your name [is] Jacob: your name is no longer called Jacob, but Israel is your name”; and He calls his name Israel.
\v 11 And God says to him, “I [am] God Almighty; be fruitful and multiply, a nation and an assembly of nations is from you, and kings from your loins go out;
\v 12 and the land which I have given to Abraham and to Isaac—to you I give it, indeed to your seed after you I give the land.”
\v 13 And God goes up from him, in the place where He has spoken with him.
\v 14 And Jacob sets up a standing pillar in the place where He has spoken with him, a standing pillar of stone, and he pours on it an oblation, and he pours on it oil;
\v 15 and Jacob calls the name of the place where God spoke with him Bethel.
\v 16 And they journey from Bethel, and there is yet a distance of land before entering Ephratha, and Rachel bears, and is sharply pained in her bearing;
\v 17 and it comes to pass, in her being sharply pained in her bearing, that the midwife says to her, “Do not fear, for this also [is] a son for you.”
\v 18 And it comes to pass in the going out of her soul (for she died), that she calls his name Ben-Oni; and his father called him Benjamin;
\v 19 and Rachel dies, and is buried in the way to Ephratha, which [is] Beth-Lehem,
\v 20 and Jacob sets up a standing pillar over her grave; which [is] the standing pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.
\v 21 And Israel journeys, and stretches out his tent beyond the Tower of Edar;
\v 22 and it comes to pass in Israel’s dwelling in that land, that Reuben goes, and lies with his father’s concubine Bilhah; and Israel hears.
\v 23 And the sons of Jacob are twelve. Sons of Leah: Jacob’s firstborn Reuben, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.
\v 24 Sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
\v 25 And sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maidservant: Dan and Naphtali.
\v 26 And sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant: Gad and Asher. These [are] sons of Jacob, who have been born to him in Padan-Aram.
\v 27 And Jacob comes to his father Isaac, at Mamre, the city of Arba (which [is] Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac have sojourned.
\v 28 And the days of Isaac are one hundred and eighty years,
\v 29 and Isaac expires, and dies, and is gathered to his people, aged and satisfied with days; and his sons Esau and Jacob bury him.
\c 36
\p
\v 1 And these [are] the generations of Esau, who [is] Edom.
\v 2 Esau has taken his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
\v 3 and Bashemath daughter of Ishmael, sister of Nebajoth.
\v 4 And Adah bears to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath has borne Reuel;
\v 5 and Aholibamah has borne Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. These [are] sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
\v 6 And Esau takes his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his livestock, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he has acquired in the land of Canaan, and goes into the country from the face of his brother Jacob;
\v 7 for their substance was more abundant than to dwell together, and the land of their sojournings was not able to bear them because of their livestock;
\v 8 and Esau dwells in Mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
\v 9 And these [are] the generations of Esau, father of Edom, in Mount Seir.
\v 10 These [are] the names of the sons of Esau: Eliphaz son of Adah, wife of Esau; Reuel son of Bashemath, wife of Esau.

\v 20 These [are] sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,
\v 21 and Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan; these [are] chiefs of the Horites, sons of Seir, in the land of Edom.
\v 22 And the sons of Lotan are Hori and Heman; and a sister of Lotan [is] Timna.
\v 23 And these [are] sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
\v 24 And these [are] sons of Zibeon, both Ajah and Anah: it [is] Anah that has found the Imim in the wilderness, in his feeding the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
\v 25 And these [are] sons of Anah: Dishon, and Aholibamah daughter of Anah.
\v 26 And these [are] sons of Dishon: Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.
\v 27 These [are] sons of Ezer: Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.
\v 28 These [are] sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
\v 29 These [are] chiefs of the Horite: Chief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief Zibeon, Chief Anah,
\v 30 Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, Chief Dishan: these [are] chiefs of the Horite in reference to their chiefs in the land of Seir.
\v 31 And these [are] the kings who have reigned in the land of Edom before the reigning of a king over the sons of Israel.
\v 32 And Bela son of Beor reigns in Edom, and the name of his city [is] Dinhabah;
\v 33 and Bela dies, and Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah reigns in his stead;
\v 34 and Jobab dies, and Husham from the land of the Temanite reigns in his stead.

\v 41 Chief Aholibamah, Chief Elah, Chief Pinon,
\v 42 Chief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief Mibzar,
\v 43 Chief Magdiel, Chief Iram: these [are] chiefs of Edom, in reference to their dwellings, in the land of their possession; he [is] Esau father of Edom.
\c 37
\p
\v 1 And Jacob dwells in the land of his father’s sojournings—in the land of Canaan.
\v 2 These [are] the generations of Jacob: Joseph, a son of seventeen years, has been enjoying himself with his brothers among the flock (and he [is] a youth), with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives, and Joseph brings in an account of their evil to their father.
\v 3 And Israel has loved Joseph more than any of his sons, for he [is] a son of his old age, and has made for him a long coat;
\v 4 and his brothers see that their father has loved him more than any of his brothers, and they hate him, and have not been able to speak [to] him peaceably.
\v 5 And Joseph dreams a dream, and declares to his brothers, and they add still more to hate him.
\v 6 And he says to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:
\v 7 that, behold, we are binding bundles in the midst of the field, and behold, my bundle has arisen, and has also stood up, and behold, your bundles are all around, and they bow themselves to my bundle.”
\v 8 And his brothers say to him, “Do you certainly reign over us? Do you certainly rule over us?” And they add still more to hate him, for his dreams, and for his words.
\v 9 And he dreams yet another dream, and recounts it to his brothers, and says, “Behold, I have dreamed a dream again, and behold, the sun and the moon, and eleven stars, are bowing themselves to me.”
\v 10 And he recounts to his father, and to his brothers; and his father pushes against him, and says to him, “What [is] this dream which you have dreamed? Do we certainly come, I, and your mother, and your brothers—to bow ourselves to you, to the earth?”
\v 11 And his brothers are zealous against him, and his father has watched the matter.
\v 12 And his brothers go to feed the flock of their father in Shechem,
\v 13 and Israel says to Joseph, “Are your brothers not feeding in Shechem? Come, and I send you to them”; and he says to him, “Here I [am]”;
\v 14 and he says to him, “Now go see the peace of your brothers, and the peace of the flock, and bring me back word”; and he sends him from the Valley of Hebron, and he comes to Shechem.
\v 15 And a man finds him, and behold, he is wandering in the field, and the man asks him, saying, “What do you seek?”
\v 16 And he says, “I am seeking my brothers, please declare to me where they are feeding.”
\v 17 And the man says, “They have journeyed from this, for I have heard some saying, Let us go to Dothan,” and Joseph goes after his brothers, and finds them in Dothan.
\v 18 And they see him from afar, even before he draws near to them, and they conspire against him to put him to death.
\v 19 And they say to one another, “Behold, this man of the dreams comes;
\v 20 and now, come, and we slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and have said, An evil beast has devoured him; and we see what his dreams are.”
\v 21 And Reuben hears, and delivers him out of their hand, and says, “Let us not strike the life”;
\v 22 and Reuben says to them, “Shed no blood; cast him into this pit which [is] in the wilderness, and do not put forth a hand on him,” in order to deliver him out of their hand, to bring him back to his father.
\v 23 And it comes to pass, when Joseph has come to his brothers, that they strip Joseph of his coat, the long coat which [is] on him,
\v 24 and take him and cast him into the pit, and the pit [is] empty, there is no water in it.
\v 25 And they sit down to eat bread, and they lift up their eyes, and look, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, and their camels carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh, going to take [them] down to Egypt.
\v 26 And Judah says to his brothers, “What gain when we slay our brother, and have concealed his blood?
\v 27 Come, and we sell him to the Ishmaelites, and our hands are not on him, for he [is] our brother—our flesh”; and his brothers listen.
\v 28 And Midianite merchantmen pass by and they draw out and bring up Joseph out of the pit, and sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver, and they bring Joseph into Egypt.
\v 29 And Reuben returns to the pit, and behold, Joseph is not in the pit, and he tears his garments,
\v 30 and he returns to his brothers and says, “The boy is not, and I—to where am I going?”
\v 31 And they take the coat of Joseph, and slaughter a kid of the goats, and dip the coat in the blood,
\v 32 and send the long coat, and they bring [it] to their father, and say, “We have found this; please discern whether it [is] your son’s coat or not.”
\v 33 And he discerns it and says, “My son’s coat! An evil beast has devoured him; torn—Joseph is torn!”
\v 34 And Jacob tears his raiment, and puts sackcloth on his loins, and becomes a mourner for his son many days,
\v 35 and all his sons and all his daughters rise to comfort him, and he refuses to comfort himself, and says, “For I go down to my son mourning, to Sheol,” and his father weeps for him.
\v 36 And the Midianites have sold him to Egypt, to Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, head of the executioners.
\c 38
\p
\v 1 And it comes to pass, at that time, that Judah goes down from his brothers, and turns aside to a man, an Adullamite, whose name [is] Hirah;
\v 2 and Judah sees there the daughter of a man, a Canaanite, whose name [is] Shuah, and takes her, and goes in to her.
\v 3 And she conceives, and bears a son, and he calls his name Er;
\v 4 and she conceives again, and bears a son, and calls his name Onan;
\v 5 and she adds again, and bears a son, and calls his name Shelah; and he was in Chezib in her bearing him.
\v 6 And Judah takes a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name [is] Tamar;
\v 7 and Er, Judah’s firstborn, is evil in the eyes of YHWH, and YHWH puts him to death.
\v 8 And Judah says to Onan, “Go in to the wife of your brother, and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother”;
\v 9 and Onan knows that the seed is not [reckoned] his; and it has come to pass, if he has gone in to his brother’s wife, that he has destroyed [it] to the earth, so as not to give seed to his brother;
\v 10 and that which he has done is evil in the eyes of YHWH, and He puts him also to death.
\v 11 And Judah says to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Abide [as] a widow at your father’s house, until my son Shelah grows up”; for he said, “Lest he die—even he—like his brothers”; and Tamar goes and dwells at her father’s house.
\v 12 And the days are multiplied, and the daughter of Shuah, Judah’s wife, dies; and Judah is comforted, and goes up to his sheep-shearers, he and Hirah his friend the Adullamite, to Timnath.
\v 13 And it is declared to Tamar, saying, “Behold, your husband’s father is going up to Timnath to shear his flock”;
\v 14 and she turns aside the garments of her widowhood from off her, and covers herself with a veil, and wraps herself up, and sits in the opening of Enayim, which [is] by the way to Timnath, for she has seen that Shelah has grown up, and she has not been given to him for a wife.
\v 15 And Judah sees her, and reckons her for a harlot, for she has covered her face,
\v 16 and he turns aside to her by the way and says, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he has not known that she [is] his daughter-in-law; and she says, “What do you give to me, that you may come in to me?”
\v 17 And he says, “I send a kid of the goats from the flock.” And she says, “Do you give a pledge until you send [it]?”
\v 18 And he says, “What [is] the pledge that I give to you?” And she says, “Your seal, and your ribbon, and your staff which [is] in your hand”; and he gives to her, and goes in to her, and she conceives to him;
\v 19 and she rises, and goes, and turns aside her veil from off her, and puts on the garments of her widowhood.
\v 20 And Judah sends the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the hand of the woman, and he has not found her.
\v 21 And he asks the men of her place, saying, “Where [is] the separated one—she in Enayim, by the way?” And they say, “There has not been in this [place] a separated one.”
\v 22 And he turns back to Judah and says, “I have not found her; and the men of the place also have said, There has not been in this [place] a separated one,”
\v 23 and Judah says, “Let her take to herself, lest we become despised; behold, I sent this kid, and you have not found her.”
\v 24 And it comes to pass about three months [after], that it is declared to Judah, saying, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has committed fornication; and also, behold, she has conceived by fornication”: and Judah says, “Bring her out—and she is burned.”
\v 25 She is brought out, and she has sent to her husband’s father, saying, “To a man whose these [are], I [am] pregnant”; and she says, “Please discern whose these [are]—the seal, and the ribbons, and the staff.”
\v 26 And Judah discerns and says, “She has been more righteous than I, because that I did not give her to my son Shelah”; and he has not added to know her again.
\v 27 And it comes to pass in the time of her bearing, that behold, twins [are] in her womb;
\v 28 and it comes to pass in her bearing, that [one] gives out a hand, and the midwife takes and binds on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, “This has come out first.”
\v 29 And it comes to pass as he draws back his hand, that behold, his brother has come out, and she says, “What! You have broken forth—the breach [is] on you”; and he calls his name Perez;
\v 30 and afterward his brother has come out, on whose hand [is] the scarlet thread, and he calls his name Zerah.
\c 39
\p
\v 1 And Joseph has been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, head of the executioners, an Egyptian man, buys him out of the hands of the Ishmaelites who have brought him there.
\v 2 And YHWH is with Joseph, and he is a prosperous man, and he is in the house of his lord the Egyptian,
\v 3 and his lord sees that YHWH is with him, and all that he is doing YHWH is causing to prosper in his hand,
\v 4 and Joseph finds grace in his eyes and serves him, and he appoints him over his house, and all that he has he has given into his hand.
\v 5 And it comes to pass from the time that he has appointed him over his house, and over all that he has, that YHWH blesses the house of the Egyptian for Joseph’s sake, and the blessing of YHWH is on all that he has, in the house, and in the field;
\v 6 and he leaves all that he has in the hand of Joseph, and he has not known anything that he has, except the bread which he is eating. And Joseph is of a handsome form, and of a handsome appearance.
\v 7 And it comes to pass after these things, that his lord’s wife lifts up her eyes to Joseph and says, “Lie with me”;
\v 8 and he refuses and says to his lord’s wife, “Behold, my lord has not known what [is] with me in the house, and all that he has he has given into my hand;
\v 9 none is greater in this house than I, and he has not withheld from me anything, except you, because you [are] his wife; and how will I do this great evil? Then I have sinned against God.”
\v 10 And it comes to pass at her speaking to Joseph day [by] day, that he has not listened to her, to lie near her, to be with her;
\v 11 and it comes to pass about this day, that he goes into the house to do his work, and there is none of the men of the house there in the house,
\v 12 and she catches him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me”; and he leaves his garment in her hand, and flees, and goes outside.
\v 13 And it comes to pass, when she sees that he has left his garment in her hand, and flees outside,
\v 14 that she calls for the men of her house, and speaks to them, saying, “See, he has brought a man to us, a Hebrew, to play with us; he has come in to me, to lie with me, and I call with a loud voice,
\v 15 and it comes to pass, when he hears that I have lifted up my voice and call, that he leaves his garment near me, and flees, and goes outside.”
\v 16 And she places his garment near her, until the coming in of his lord to his house.
\v 17 And she speaks to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant whom you have brought to us, has come in to me to play with me;
\v 18 and it comes to pass, when I lift my voice and call, that he leaves his garment near me, and flees outside.”
\v 19 And it comes to pass, when his lord hears the words of his wife, which she has spoken to him, saying, “According to these things has your servant done to me,” that his anger burns;
\v 20 and Joseph’s lord takes him, and puts him to the round-house, a place where the king’s prisoners [are] bound; and he is there in the round-house.
\v 21 And YHWH is with Joseph, and stretches out kindness to him, and puts his grace in the eyes of the chief of the round-house;
\v 22 and the chief of the round-house gives into the hand of Joseph all the prisoners who [are] in the round-house, and of all that they are doing there, he has been doer;
\v 23 the chief of the round-house does not see anything under his hand, because YHWH [is] with him, and that which he is doing YHWH is causing to prosper.
\c 40
\p
\v 1 And it comes to pass, after these things—the butler of the king of Egypt and the baker have sinned against their lord, against the king of Egypt;
\v 2 and Pharaoh is angry against his two eunuchs, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers,
\v 3 and puts them in confinement in the house of the chief of the executioners, into the round-house, the place where Joseph [is] a prisoner,
\v 4 and the chief of the executioners charges Joseph with them, and he serves them; and they are in confinement [for some] days.
\v 5 And they dream a dream both of them, each his dream in one night, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker whom the king of Egypt has, who [are] prisoners in the round-house.
\v 6 And Joseph comes to them in the morning, and sees them, and behold, they [are] morose;
\v 7 and he asks Pharaoh’s eunuchs who [are] with him in confinement in the house of his lord, saying, “Why [are] your faces sad today?”
\v 8 And they say to him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it”; and Joseph says to them, “Are interpretations not with God? Please recount to me.”
\v 9 And the chief of the butlers recounts his dream to Joseph and says to him, “In my dream, then behold, a vine [is] before me!
\v 10 And in the vine [are] three branches, and it [is] as it were flourishing; gone up has its blossom, its clusters have ripened grapes;
\v 11 and Pharaoh’s cup [is] in my hand, and I take the grapes and press them into the cup of Pharaoh, and I give the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.”
\v 12 And Joseph says to him, “This [is] its interpretation: the three branches are three days;
\v 13 yet, within three days Pharaoh lifts up your head, and has put you back on your station, and you have given the cup of Pharaoh into his hand, according to the former custom when you were his butler.
\v 14 Surely if you have remembered me with you, when it is well with you, and have please done kindness with me, and have made mention of me to Pharaoh, then you have brought me out from this house,
\v 15 for I was really stolen from the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have done nothing that they have put me in the pit [for].”
\v 16 And the chief of the bakers sees that he has interpreted good, and he says to Joseph, “I also [am] in a dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread [are] on my head,
\v 17 and in the highest basket [are] of all [kinds] of Pharaoh’s food, work of a baker; and the birds are eating them out of the basket, from off my head.”
\v 18 And Joseph answers and says, “This [is] its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;
\v 19 yet, within three days Pharaoh lifts up your head from off you, and has hanged you on a tree, and the birds have eaten your flesh from off you.”
\v 20 And it comes to pass, on the third day, Pharaoh’s birthday, that he makes a banquet to all his servants, and lifts up the head of the chief of the butlers, and the head of the chief of the bakers among his servants,
\v 21 and he puts back the chief of the butlers to his butlership, and he gives the cup into the hand of Pharaoh;
\v 22 and the chief of the bakers he has hanged, as Joseph has interpreted to them;
\v 23 and the chief of the butlers has not remembered Joseph, but forgets him.
\c 41
\p
\v 1 And it comes to pass, at the end of two years of days that Pharaoh is dreaming, and behold, he is standing by the River,
\v 2 and behold, from the River coming up are seven cows, of beautiful appearance, and fat [in] flesh, and they feed among the reeds;
\v 3 and behold, seven other cows are coming up after them out of the River, of bad appearance, and lean [in] flesh, and they stand near the cows on the edge of the River,
\v 4 and the cows of bad appearance and lean [in] flesh eat up the seven cows of beautiful appearance, and fat—and Pharaoh awakens.
\v 5 And he sleeps, and dreams a second time, and behold, seven ears are coming up on one stalk, fat and good,
\v 6 and behold, seven ears, thin, and blasted with an east wind, are springing up after them;
\v 7 and the thin ears swallow the seven fat and full ears—and Pharaoh awakens, and behold, a dream.
\v 8 And it comes to pass in the morning, that his spirit is moved, and he sends and calls all the enchanters of Egypt, and all its wise men, and Pharaoh recounts to them his dream, and there is no interpreter of them to Pharaoh.
\v 9 And the chief of the butlers speaks with Pharaoh, saying, “I mention my sin this day:
\v 10 Pharaoh has been angry against his servants, and puts me in confinement in the house of the chief of the executioners, me and the chief of the bakers;
\v 11 and we dream a dream in one night, I and he, each according to the interpretation of his dream we have dreamed.
\v 12 And there [is] with us a youth, a Hebrew, servant to the chief of the executioners, and we recount to him, and he interprets to us our dreams, [to] each according to his dream has he interpreted,
\v 13 and it comes to pass, as he has interpreted to us so it has been, me he put back on my station, and him he hanged.”
\v 14 And Pharaoh sends and calls Joseph, and they cause him to run out of the pit, and he shaves, and changes his garments, and comes to Pharaoh.
\v 15 And Pharaoh says to Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it, and I have heard concerning you, saying, You understand a dream to interpret it,”
\v 16 and Joseph answers Pharaoh, saying, “Without me—God answers Pharaoh with peace.”
\v 17 And Pharaoh speaks to Joseph: “In my dream, behold, I am standing by the edge of the River,
\v 18 and behold, out of the River coming up are seven cows, fat [in] flesh, and of beautiful form, and they feed among the reeds;
\v 19 and behold, seven other cows are coming up after them, thin, and of very bad form, and lean [in] flesh; I have not seen like these in all the land of Egypt for badness.
\v 20 And the lean and the bad cows eat up the first seven fat cows,
\v 21 and they come in to their midst, and it has not been known that they have come in to their midst, and their appearance [is] bad as at the commencement; and I awake.
\v 22 And I see in my dream, and behold, seven ears are coming up on one stalk, full and good;
\v 23 and behold, seven ears, withered, thin, blasted with an east wind, are springing up after them;
\v 24 and the thin ears swallow the seven good ears; and I tell [it] to the enchanters, and there is none declaring [it] to me.”
\v 25 And Joseph says to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one: that which God is doing he has declared to Pharaoh;
\v 26 the seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years, the dream is one;
\v 27 and the seven thin and bad cows which are coming up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears, blasted with an east wind, are seven years of famine;
\v 28 this [is] the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is doing.
\v 29 Behold, seven years are coming of great abundance in all the land of Egypt,
\v 30 and seven years of famine have arisen after them, and all the plenty is forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine has finished the land,
\v 31 and the plenty is not known in the land because of that famine afterward, for it [is] very grievous.
\v 32 And because of the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, surely the thing is established by God, and God is hurrying to do it.
\v 33 And now, let Pharaoh provide a man, intelligent and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt;
\v 34 let Pharaoh make and appoint overseers over the land, and receive a fifth of the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty,
\v 35 and they gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and heap up grain under the hand of Pharaoh—food in the cities; and they have kept [it],
\v 36 and the food has been for a store for the land, for the seven years of famine which are in the land of Egypt; and the land is cut off by the famine.”
\v 37 And the thing is good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants,
\v 38 and Pharaoh says to his servants, “Do we find like this, a man in whom the Spirit of God [is]?”
\v 39 And Pharaoh says to Joseph, “After God’s causing you to know all this, there is none intelligent and wise as you;
\v 40 you are over my house, and at your mouth do all my people kiss; only in the throne I am greater than you.”
\v 41 And Pharaoh says to Joseph, “See, I have put you over all the land of Egypt.”
\v 42 And Pharaoh turns aside his seal-ring from off his hand, and puts it on the hand of Joseph, and clothes him [with] garments of fine linen, and places a chain of gold on his neck,
\v 43 and causes him to ride in the second chariot which he has, and they proclaim before him, “Bow the knee!” And [he] set him over all the land of Egypt.
\v 44 And Pharaoh says to Joseph, “I [am] Pharaoh, and without you a man does not lift up his hand and his foot in all the land of Egypt”;
\v 45 and Pharaoh calls Joseph’s name Zaphnath-Paaneah, and he gives to him Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On, for a wife, and Joseph goes out over the land of Egypt.
\v 46 And Joseph [is] a son of thirty years in his standing before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and Joseph goes out from the presence of Pharaoh, and passes over through all the land of Egypt;
\v 47 and the land makes in the seven years of plenty by handfuls.
\v 48 And he gathers all the food of the seven years which have been in the land of Egypt, and puts food in the cities; the food of the field which [is] around [each] city has he put in its midst;
\v 49 and Joseph gathers grain as sand of the sea, multiplying exceedingly, until he has ceased to number, for there is no number.
\v 50 And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine comes, whom Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On, has borne to him,
\v 51 and Joseph calls the name of the firstborn Manasseh: “For God has made me to forget all my labor, and all the house of my father”;
\v 52 and the name of the second he has called Ephraim: “For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.”
\v 53 And the seven years of plenty are completed which have been in the land of Egypt,
\v 54 and the seven years of famine begin to come, as Joseph said, and famine is in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt has been bread;
\v 55 and all the land of Egypt is famished, and the people cry to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh says to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; that which he says to you—do.”
\v 56 And the famine has been over all the face of the land, and Joseph opens all [places] which have [grain] in them, and sells to the Egyptians; and the famine is severe in the land of Egypt,
\v 57 and all the earth has come to Egypt, to buy, to Joseph, for the famine was severe in all the earth.
\c 42
\p
\v 1 And Jacob sees that there is grain in Egypt, and Jacob says to his sons, “Why do you look at each other?”
\v 2 He also says, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt, go down there, and buy for us from there, and we live and do not die”;
\v 3 and the ten brothers of Joseph go down to buy grain in Egypt,
\v 4 and Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob has not sent with his brothers, for he said, “Lest harm meet him.”
\v 5 And the sons of Israel come to buy in the midst of those coming, for the famine has been in the land of Canaan,
\v 6 and Joseph is the ruler over the land, he who is selling to all the people of the land, and Joseph’s brothers come and bow themselves to him—face to the earth.
\v 7 And Joseph sees his brothers, and discerns them, and makes himself strange to them, and speaks sharp things with them, and says to them, “From where have you come?” And they say, “From the land of Canaan—to buy food.”
\v 8 And Joseph discerns his brothers, but they have not discerned him,
\v 9 and Joseph remembers the dreams which he dreamed of them and says to them, “You [are] spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.”
\v 10 And they say to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food;
\v 11 we [are] all of us sons of one man, we [are] right men; your servants have not been spies”;
\v 12 and he says to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land”;
\v 13 and they say, “Your servants [are] twelve brothers; we [are] sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the young one [is] with our father today, and one is not.”
\v 14 And Joseph says to them, “This [is] that which I have spoken to you, saying, You [are] spies,
\v 15 by this you are proved: [as] Pharaoh lives, if you go out from this—except by your young brother coming here;
\v 16 send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and you, remain bound, and let your words be proved, whether truth be with you: and if not, [as] Pharaoh lives, surely you [are] spies”;
\v 17 and he gathers them into confinement [for] three days.
\v 18 And Joseph says to them on the third day, “Do this and live; I fear God!
\v 19 If you [are] right men, let one of your brothers be bound in the house of your confinement, and you, go, carry in grain [for] the famine of your houses,
\v 20 and you bring your young brother to me, and your words are established, and you do not die”; and they do so.
\v 21 And they say to one another, “Truly we [are] guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul, in his making supplication to us, and we did not listen: therefore this distress has come on us.”
\v 22 And Reuben answers them, saying, “Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the boy? And you did not listen; and his blood also, behold, it is required.”
\v 23 And they have not known that Joseph understands, for the interpreter [is] between them;
\v 24 and he turns around from them, and weeps, and turns back to them, and speaks to them, and takes Simeon from them, and binds him before their eyes.
\v 25 And Joseph commands, and they fill their vessels [with] grain, also to put back the money of each of them into his sack, and to give to them provision for the way; and one does to them so.
\v 26 And they lift up their grain on their donkeys, and go from there,
\v 27 and the one opens his sack to give provender to his donkey at a lodging-place, and he sees his money, and behold, it [is] in the mouth of his bag,
\v 28 and he says to his brothers, “My money has been put back, and also, behold, in my bag”: and their heart goes out, and they tremble, to one another saying, “What [is] this God has done to us!”
\v 29 And they come to their father Jacob, to the land of Canaan, and they declare to him all the things meeting them, saying,
\v 30 “The man, the lord of the land, has spoken with us sharp things, and makes us as spies of the land;
\v 31 and we say to him, We [are] right men, we have not been spies,
\v 32 we [are] twelve brothers, sons of our father, one is not, and the young one [is] today with our father in the land of Canaan.
\v 33 And the man, the lord of the land, says to us, By this I know that you [are] right men—leave one of your brothers with me, and take [for] the famine of your houses and go,
\v 34 and bring your young brother to me, and I know that you [are] not spies, but you [are] right men; I give your brother to you, and you trade with the land.”
\v 35 And it comes to pass, they are emptying their sacks, and behold, the bundle of each man’s silver [is] in his sack, and they see their bundles of silver, they and their father, and are afraid;
\v 36 and their father Jacob says to them, “You have bereaved me; Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and Benjamin you take—all these [things] have been against me.”
\v 37 And Reuben speaks to his father, saying, “You put to death my two sons, if I do not bring him to you; give him into my hand, and I bring him back to you”;
\v 38 and he says, “My son does not go down with you, for his brother [is] dead, and he by himself is left; when harm has met him in the way in which you go, then you have brought down my grey hairs in sorrow to Sheol.”
\c 43
\p
\v 1 And the famine [is] severe in the land;
\v 2 and it comes to pass, when they have finished eating the grain which they brought from Egypt, that their father says to them, “Return, buy for us a little food.”
\v 3 And Judah speaks to him, saying, “The man protesting protested to us, saying, You do not see my face without your brother [being] with you;
\v 4 if you are sending our brother with us, we go down, and buy for you food,
\v 5 and if you are not sending—we do not go down, for the man said to us, You do not see my face without your brother [being] with you.”
\v 6 And Israel says, “Why did you do evil to me, by declaring to the man that you had yet a brother?”
\v 7 And they say, “The man asked diligently concerning us, and concerning our family, saying, Is your father yet alive? Have you a brother? And we declare to him according to the tenor of these things; do we certainly know that he will say, Bring down your brother?”
\v 8 And Judah says to his father Israel, “Send the youth with me, and we arise, and go, and live, and do not die, both we, and you, and our infants.
\v 9 I am guarantor [for] him, from my hand you require him; if I have not brought him to you, and set him before you—then I have sinned against you all the days;
\v 10 for if we had not lingered, surely now we had returned these two times.”
\v 11 And their father Israel says to them, “If so, now, do this: take of the praised thing of the land in your vessels, and take down to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds;
\v 12 and double money take in your hand, even the money which is brought back in the mouth of your bags, you take back in your hand, it may be it [is] an oversight.
\v 13 And take your brother, and rise, return to the man;
\v 14 and God Almighty give to you mercies before the man, so that he has sent to you your other brother and Benjamin; and I, when I am bereaved—I am bereaved.”
\v 15 And the men take this present, double money also they have taken in their hand, and Benjamin; and they rise, and go down to Egypt, and stand before Joseph;
\v 16 and Joseph sees Benjamin with them and says to him who [is] over his house, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal, and make ready, for the men eat with me at noon.”
\v 17 And the man does as Joseph has said, and the man brings in the men into the house of Joseph,
\v 18 and the men are afraid because they have been brought into the house of Joseph, and they say, “For the matter of the money which was put back in our bags at the commencement are we brought in—to roll himself on us, and to throw himself on us, and to take us for servants—our donkeys also.”
\v 19 And they come near to the man who [is] over the house of Joseph, and speak to him at the opening of the house,
\v 20 and say, “O my lord, we really come down at the commencement to buy food;
\v 21 and it comes to pass, when we have come to the lodging-place, and open our bags, that behold, each one’s money [is] in the mouth of his bag, our money in its weight, and we bring it back in our hand;
\v 22 and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we have not known who put our money in our bags.”
\v 23 And he says, “Peace to you, do not fear: your God and the God of your father has given to you hidden treasure in your bags, your money came to me”; and he brings out Simeon to them.
\v 24 And the man brings in the men into Joseph’s house, and gives water, and they wash their feet; and he gives provender for their donkeys,
\v 25 and they prepare the present until the coming of Joseph at noon, for they have heard that there they eat bread.
\v 26 And Joseph comes into the house, and they bring to him the present which [is] in their hand, into the house, and bow themselves to him, to the earth;
\v 27 and he asks of them of peace and says, “Is your father well? The aged man of whom you have spoken, is he yet alive?”
\v 28 And they say, “Your servant our father [is] well, he is yet alive”; and they bow, and pay respect.
\v 29 And he lifts up his eyes and sees his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and says, “Is this your young brother, of whom you have spoken to me?” And he says, “God favor you, my son.”
\v 30 And Joseph hurries, for his bowels have been moved for his brother, and he seeks to weep, and enters the inner chamber, and weeps there;
\v 31 and he washes his face, and goes out, and refrains himself, and says, “Place bread.”
\v 32 And they place for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who are eating with him by themselves: for the Egyptians are unable to eat bread with the Hebrews, for it [is] an abomination to the Egyptians.
\v 33 And they sit before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the young one according to his youth, and the men wonder one at another;
\v 34 and he lifts up gifts from before him to them, and the gift of Benjamin is five hands more than the gifts of all of them; and they drink, indeed, they drink abundantly with him.
\c 44
\p
\v 1 And he commands him who [is] over his house, saying, “Fill the bags of the men [with] food, as they are able to carry, and put the money of each in the mouth of his bag;
\v 2 and my cup, the silver cup, you put in the mouth of the bag of the young one, and his grain-money”; and he does according to the word of Joseph which he has spoken.
\v 3 The morning is bright, and the men have been sent away, they and their donkeys—
\v 4 they have gone out of the city—they have not gone far off—and Joseph has said to him who [is] over his house, “Rise, pursue after the men; and you have overtaken them, and you have said to them: Why have you repaid evil for good?
\v 5 Is this not that with which my lord drinks? And he observes diligently with it; you have done evil [in] that which you have done.”
\v 6 And he overtakes them, and speaks to them these words,
\v 7 and they say to him, “Why does my lord speak according to these words? Far be it from your servants to do according to this word;
\v 8 behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our bags we brought back to you from the land of Canaan, and how do we steal from the house of your lord silver or gold?
\v 9 With whomsoever of your servants it is found, he has died, and we also are to my lord for servants.”
\v 10 And he says, “Now also, according to your words, so it [is]; he with whom it is found becomes my servant, and you are acquitted”;
\v 11 and they hurry and take down each his bag to the earth, and each opens his bag;
\v 12 and he searches—at the eldest he has begun, and at the youngest he has completed—and the cup is found in the bag of Benjamin;
\v 13 and they tear their garments, and each loads his donkey, and they return to the city.
\v 14 And Judah and his brothers come to the house of Joseph, and he is yet there, and they fall to the earth before him;
\v 15 and Joseph says to them, “What [is] this deed that you have done? Have you not known that a man like me diligently observes?”
\v 16 And Judah says, “What do we say to my lord? What do we speak? And how do we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we [are] servants to my lord, both we, and he in whose hand the cup has been found”;
\v 17 and he says, “Far be it from me to do this; the man in whose hand the cup has been found, he becomes my servant; and you, go up in peace to your father.”
\v 18 And Judah comes near to him and says, “O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord, and do not let your anger burn against your servant—for you are as Pharaoh.
\v 19 My lord has asked his servants, saying, Do you have a father or brother?
\v 20 And we say to my lord, We have a father, an aged one, and a child of old age, a little one; and his brother died, and he is left alone of his mother, and his father has loved him.
\v 21 And you say to your servants, Bring him down to me, and I set my eye on him;
\v 22 and we say to my lord, The youth is not able to leave his father, when he has left his father, then he has died;
\v 23 and you say to your servants, If your young brother does not come down with you, you do not add to see my face.
\v 24 And it comes to pass, that we have come up to your servant my father, that we declare to him the words of my lord;
\v 25 and our father says, Return, buy for us a little food,
\v 26 and we say, We are not able to go down; if our young brother is with us, then we have gone down; for we are not able to see the man’s face, and our young brother not with us.
\v 27 And your servant my father says to us, You have known that my wife bore two to me,
\v 28 and one goes out from me, and I say, Surely he is torn—torn! And I have not seen him since;
\v 29 when you have taken also this from my presence, and harm has met him, then you have brought down my grey hairs with evil to Sheol.
\v 30 And now, at my coming to your servant my father, and the youth not with us (and his soul is bound up in his soul),
\v 31 then it has come to pass, when he sees that the youth is not, that he has died, and your servants have brought down the grey hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol;
\v 32 for your servant obtained the youth by guarantee to my father, saying, If I do not bring him to you—then I have sinned against my father all the days.
\v 33 And now, please let your servant abide instead of the youth [as] a servant to my lord, and the youth goes up with his brothers,
\v 34 for how do I go up to my father, and the youth not with me? Lest I look on the evil which finds my father.”
\c 45
\p
\v 1 And Joseph has not been able to refrain himself before all those standing by him, and he calls, “Put out every man from me”; and no man has stood with him when Joseph makes himself known to his brothers,
\v 2 and he gives forth his voice in weeping, and the Egyptians hear, and the house of Pharaoh hears.
\v 3 And Joseph says to his brothers, “I [am] Joseph, is my father yet alive?” And his brothers have not been able to answer him, for they have been troubled at his presence.
\v 4 And Joseph says to his brothers, “Please come near to me,” and they come near; and he says, “I [am] your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt;
\v 5 and now, do not be grieved, nor let it be displeasing in your eyes that you sold me here, for God has sent me before you to preserve life.
\v 6 Because these two years the famine [is] in the heart of the land, and yet five years [remain in] which there is neither plowing nor harvest;
\v 7 and God sends me before you, to place a remnant of you in the land, and to give life to you by a great escape;
\v 8 and now, you have not sent me here, but God, and He sets me for a father to Pharaoh, and for lord to all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
\v 9 Hurry, and go up to my father, then you have said to him, Thus said your son Joseph: God has set me for lord to all Egypt; come down to me, do not stay,
\v 10 and you have dwelt in the land of Goshen, and been near to me, you and your sons, and your son’s sons, and your flock, and your herd, and all that you have,
\v 11 and I have nourished you there—for yet [are] five years of famine—lest you become poor, you and your household, and all that you have.
\v 12 And behold, your eyes are seeing, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that [it is] my mouth which is speaking to you;
\v 13 and you have declared to my father all my glory in Egypt, and all that you have seen, and you have hurried, and have brought down my father here.”
\v 14 And he falls on the neck of his brother Benjamin, and weeps, and Benjamin has wept on his neck;
\v 15 and he kisses all his brothers, and weeps over them; and afterward his brothers have spoken with him.
\v 16 And the sound has been heard in the house of Pharaoh, saying, “The brothers of Joseph have come”; and it is good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants,
\v 17 and Pharaoh says to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, This you do: load your beasts, and go, enter the land of Canaan,
\v 18 and take your father, and your households, and come to me, and I give to you the good of the land of Egypt, and you eat the fat of the land.
\v 19 Indeed, you have been commanded: this you do, take for yourselves out of the land of Egypt, wagons for your infants, and for your wives, and you have brought your father, and come;
\v 20 and your eye has no pity on your vessels, for the good of all the land of Egypt [is] yours.”
\v 21 And the sons of Israel do so, and Joseph gives wagons to them by the command of Pharaoh, and he gives to them provision for the way;
\v 22 to all of them has he given—to each changes of garments, and to Benjamin he has given three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of garments;
\v 23 and to his father he has sent thus: ten donkeys carrying of the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys carrying grain and bread, even food for his father for the way.
\v 24 And he sends his brothers away, and they go; and he says to them, “Do not be angry in the way.”
\v 25 And they go up out of Egypt, and come to the land of Canaan, to their father Jacob,
\v 26 and they declare to him, saying, “Joseph [is] yet alive,” and that he [is] ruler over all the land of Egypt; and his heart ceases, for he has not given credence to them.
\v 27 And they speak to him all the words of Joseph, which he has spoken to them, and he sees the wagons which Joseph has sent to carry him away, and the spirit of their father Jacob lives;
\v 28 and Israel says, “Enough! My son Joseph [is] yet alive; I go and see him before I die.”
\c 46
\p
\v 1 And Israel journeys, and all that he has, and comes to Beer-Sheba, and sacrifices sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac;
\v 2 and God speaks to Israel in visions of the night and says, “Jacob, Jacob”; and he says, “Here I [am].”
\v 3 And He says, “I [am] God, God of your father, do not be afraid of going down to Egypt, for I set you there for a great nation;
\v 4 I go down with you to Egypt, and I also certainly bring you up, and Joseph puts his hand on your eyes.”
\v 5 And Jacob rises from Beer-Sheba, and the sons of Israel carry away their father Jacob, and their infants, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh has sent to carry him,
\v 6 and they take their livestock, and their goods which they have acquired in the land of Canaan, and come into Egypt—Jacob, and all his seed with him,
\v 7 his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, indeed, all his seed he brought with him into Egypt.
\v 8 And these [are] the names of the sons of Israel who are coming into Egypt: Jacob and his sons, Jacob’s firstborn, Reuben.
\v 9 And sons of Reuben: Enoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
\v 10 And sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul son of the Canaanite.
\v 11 And sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\v 12 And sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah (and Er and Onan die in the land of Canaan). And sons of Perez are Hezron and Hamul.
\v 13 And sons of Issachar: Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.
\v 14 And sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
\v 15 These [are] sons of Leah whom she bore to Jacob in Padan-Aram, and his daughter Dinah; all the persons of his sons and his daughters [are] thirty-three.
\v 16 And sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
\v 17 And sons of Asher: Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and their sister Serah. And sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
\v 18 These [are] sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah, and she bears these to Jacob—sixteen persons.
\v 19 Sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
\v 20 And born to Joseph in the land of Egypt (whom Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On, has borne to him) [are] Manasseh and Ephraim.
\v 21 And sons of Benjamin: Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
\v 22 These [are] sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the persons [are] fourteen.
\v 23 And sons of Dan: Hushim.
\v 24 And sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
\v 25 These [are] sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel; and she bears these to Jacob—all the persons [are] seven.
\v 26 All the persons who are coming to Jacob to Egypt, coming out of his thigh, apart from the wives of Jacob’s sons, all the persons [are] sixty-six.
\v 27 And the sons of Joseph who have been born to him in Egypt [are] two persons. All the persons of the house of Jacob who are coming into Egypt [are] seventy.
\v 28 And Judah he has sent before him to Joseph, to direct before him to Goshen, and they come into the land of Goshen;
\v 29 and Joseph harnesses his chariot, and goes up to meet his father Israel, to Goshen, and appears to him, and falls on his neck, and weeps on his neck again;
\v 30 and Israel says to Joseph, “Let me die this time, after my seeing your face, for you [are] yet alive.”
\v 31 And Joseph says to his brothers, and to the house of his father, “I go up, and declare to Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers, and the house of my father who [are] in the land of Canaan have come to me;
\v 32 and the men [are] feeders of a flock, for they have been men of livestock; and their flock, and their herd, and all that they have, they have brought.
\v 33 And it has come to pass, when Pharaoh calls for you and has said, What [are] your works?
\v 34 That you have said, Your servants have been men of livestock from our youth, even until now, both we and our fathers, in order that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for the abomination of the Egyptians is everyone feeding a flock.”
\c 47
\p
\v 1 And Joseph comes and declares [it] to Pharaoh, and says, “My father, and my brothers, and their flock, and their herd, and all they have, have come from the land of Canaan, and behold, they [are] in the land of Goshen.”
\v 2 And out of his brothers he has taken five men, and sets them before Pharaoh;
\v 3 and Pharaoh says to his brothers, “What [are] your works?” And they say to Pharaoh, “Your servants [are] feeders of a flock, both we and our fathers”;
\v 4 and they say to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for the flock which your servants have, for the famine in the land of Canaan [is] grievous; and now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.”
\v 5 And Pharaoh speaks to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you:
\v 6 the land of Egypt is before you; cause your father and your brothers to dwell in the best of the land—they dwell in the land of Goshen, and if you have known, and there are among them men of ability, then you have set them [as] heads over the livestock I have.”
\v 7 And Joseph brings in his father Jacob, and causes him to stand before Pharaoh; and Jacob blesses Pharaoh.
\v 8 And Pharaoh says to Jacob, “How many [are] the days of the years of your life?”
\v 9 And Jacob says to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojournings [are] one hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not reached the days of the years of the life of my fathers, in the days of their sojournings.”
\v 10 And Jacob blesses Pharaoh, and goes out from before Pharaoh.
\v 11 And Joseph settles his father and his brothers, and gives a possession to them in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh commanded;
\v 12 and Joseph nourishes his father, and his brothers, and all the house of his father [with] bread, according to the mouth of the infants.
\v 13 And there is no bread in all the land, for the famine [is] very grievous, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan are feeble because of the famine;
\v 14 and Joseph gathers all the silver that is found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain that they are buying, and Joseph brings the silver into the house of Pharaoh.
\v 15 And the silver is consumed out of the land of Egypt and out of the land of Canaan, and all the Egyptians come to Joseph, saying, “Give bread to us—why do we die before you, though the money has ceased?”
\v 16 And Joseph says, “Give your livestock; and I give to you for your livestock, if the money has ceased.”
\v 17 And they bring in their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gives to them bread, for the horses, and for the livestock of the flock, and for the livestock of the herd, and for the donkeys; and he tends them with bread, for all their livestock, during that year.
\v 18 And that year is finished, and they come to him on the second year, and say to him, “We do not hide from my lord, that since the money has been finished, and possession of the livestock [is] to my lord, there has not been left before my lord except our bodies, and our ground;
\v 19 why do we die before your eyes, both we and our ground? Buy us and our ground for bread, and we and our ground are servants to Pharaoh; and give seed, and we live, and do not die, and the ground is not desolate.”
\v 20 And Joseph buys all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians have each sold his field, for the famine has been severe on them, and the land becomes Pharaoh’s;
\v 21 as for the people, he has removed them to cities from the [one] end of the border of Egypt even to its [other] end.
\v 22 Only the ground of the priests he has not bought, for the priests have a portion from Pharaoh, and they have eaten their portion which Pharaoh has given to them, therefore they have not sold their ground.
\v 23 And Joseph says to the people, “Behold, I have bought you today and your ground for Pharaoh; behold, seed for you, and you have sown the ground,
\v 24 and it has come to pass in the increases, that you have given a fifth to Pharaoh, and four of the parts are for yourselves, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for those who [are] in your houses, and for food for your infants.”
\v 25 And they say, “You have revived us; we find grace in the eyes of my lord, and have been servants to Pharaoh”;
\v 26 and Joseph sets it for a statute to this day, concerning the ground of Egypt, [that] Pharaoh has a fifth; only the ground of the priests alone has not become Pharaoh’s.
\v 27 And Israel dwells in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they have possession in it, and are fruitful, and multiply exceedingly;
\v 28 and Jacob lives in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, are one hundred and forty-seven years.
\v 29 And the days of Israel are near to die, and he calls for his son, for Joseph, and says to him, “Now if I have found grace in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh, and you have done kindness and truth with me; please do not bury me in Egypt,
\v 30 and I have lain with my fathers, and you have carried me out of Egypt, and buried me in their burying-place.” And he says, “I do according to your word”;
\v 31 and he says, “Swear to me”; and he swears to him, and Israel bows himself on the head of the bed.
\c 48
\p
\v 1 And it comes to pass, after these things, that [one] says to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick”; and he takes his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim.
\v 2 And [one] declares [it] to Jacob and says, “Behold, your son Joseph is coming to you”; and Israel strengthens himself, and sits on the bed.
\v 3 And Jacob says to Joseph, “God Almighty has appeared to me, in Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blesses me,
\v 4 and says to me, Behold, I am making you fruitful, and have multiplied you, and given you for an assembly of peoples, and given this land to your seed after you, a continuous possession.
\v 5 And now, your two sons, who are born to you in the land of Egypt, before my coming to you to Egypt, they [are] mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, as Reuben and Simeon, they are mine;
\v 6 and your family which you have begotten after them are yours; by the name of their brothers they are called in their inheritance.
\v 7 And I—in my coming in from Padan-[Aram] Rachel has died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, while yet a distance of land to enter Ephrata, and I bury her there in the way of Ephrata, which [is] Beth-Lehem.”
\v 8 And Israel sees the sons of Joseph and says, “Who [are] these?”
\v 9 And Joseph says to his father, “They [are] my sons, whom God has given to me in this [place]”; and he says, “Please bring them to me, and I bless them.”
\v 10 And the eyes of Israel have been heavy from age—he is unable to see; and he brings them near to him, and he kisses them and cleaves to them;
\v 11 and Israel says to Joseph, “I had not thought [possible] to see your face, and behold, God has also showed me your seed.”
\v 12 And Joseph brings them out from between his knees, and bows himself on his face to the earth;
\v 13 and Joseph takes them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left, and Manasseh in his left toward Israel’s right, and brings [them] near to him.
\v 14 And Israel puts out his right hand and places [it] on the head of Ephraim, who [is] the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh; he has guided his hands wisely, for Manasseh [is] the firstborn.
\v 15 And he blesses Joseph and says, “God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac habitually walked: God who is feeding me from my being to this day:
\v 16 the Messenger who is redeeming me from all evil blesses the youths, and my name is called on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and they increase into a multitude in the midst of the land.”
\v 17 And Joseph sees that his father sets his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and it is wrong in his eyes, and he supports the hand of his father to turn it aside from off the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasseh;
\v 18 and Joseph says to his father, “Not so, my father, for this [is] the firstborn; set your right hand on his head.”
\v 19 And his father refuses and says, “I have known, my son, I have known; he also becomes a people, and he also is great, and yet, his young brother is greater than he, and his seed is the fullness of the nations”;
\v 20 and he blesses them in that day, saying, “By you does Israel bless, saying, God set you as Ephraim and as Manasseh”; and he sets Ephraim before Manasseh.
\v 21 And Israel says to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, and God has been with you, and has brought you back to the land of your fathers;
\v 22 and I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I have taken out of the hand of the Amorite by my sword and by my bow.”
\c 49
\p
\v 1 And Jacob calls to his sons and says, “Be gathered together, and I declare to you that which happens with you in the latter end of the days.
\v 2 Be assembled, and hear, sons of Jacob, || And listen to your father Israel.
\v 3 Reuben! You [are] my firstborn, || My power, and beginning of my strength, || The abundance of exaltation, || And the abundance of strength;
\v 4 Unstable as water, you are not abundant; For you have gone up your father’s bed; Then you have defiled [it]: He went up my couch!
\v 5 Simeon and Levi [are] brothers! Instruments of violence—their espousals!
\v 6 Into their secret, do not come, O my soul! Do not be united to their assembly, O my glory; For in their anger they slew a man, || And in their self-will eradicated a prince.
\v 7 Cursed [is] their anger, for [it is] fierce, || And their wrath, for [it is] sharp; I divide them in Jacob, || And I scatter them in Israel.
\v 8 Judah! Your brothers praise you! Your hand [is] on the neck of your enemies, || Sons of your father bow themselves to you.
\v 9 A lion’s whelp [is] Judah, || For prey, my son, you have gone up; He has bent, he has crouched as a lion, || And as a lioness; who causes him to arise?
\v 10 The scepter does not turn aside from Judah, || And a lawgiver from between his feet, || Until his Seed comes; And His [is] the obedience of peoples.
\v 11 Binding to the vine his donkey, || And to the choice vine the colt of his donkey, || He has washed in wine his clothing, || And in the blood of grapes his covering;
\v 12 Red [are] eyes with wine, || And white [are] teeth with milk!
\v 13 Zebulun dwells at a haven of the seas, || And he [is] for a haven of ships; And his side [is] to Sidon.
\v 14 Issachar [is] a strong donkey, || Crouching between the two folds;
\v 15 And he sees rest, that [it is] good, || And the land, that [it is] pleasant, || And he inclines his shoulder to bear, || And is a servant for tribute.
\v 16 Dan judges his people, || As one of the tribes of Israel;
\v 17 Dan is a serpent by the way, a viper by the path, || Which is biting the horse’s heels, || And its rider falls backward.
\v 18 For Your salvation I have waited, YHWH!
\v 19 Gad! A troop assaults him, || But he assaults last.
\v 20 Out of Asher his bread [is] fat; And he gives delicacies of a king.
\v 21 Naphtali [is] a doe sent away, || Who is giving beautiful young ones.
\v 22 Joseph [is] a fruitful son; A fruitful son by a fountain, || Daughters step over the wall;
\v 23 And embitter him indeed, they have striven, || Indeed, archers hate him;
\v 24 And his bow abides in strength, || And strengthened are the arms of his hands || By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, || From where is a shepherd, a son of Israel.
\v 25 By the God of your father who helps you, || And the Mighty One who blesses you, || Blessings of the heavens from above, || Blessings of the deep lying under, || Blessings of breasts and womb—
\v 26 Your father’s blessings have been mighty || Above the blessings of my progenitors, || To the limit of the perpetual heights || They are for the head of Joseph, || And for the crown of the one || Separate [from] his brothers.
\v 27 Benjamin! A wolf tears; In the morning he eats prey, || And at evening he apportions spoil.”
\v 28 All these [are] the twelve tribes of Israel, and this [is] that which their father has spoken to them, and he blesses them; each according to his blessing he has blessed them.
\v 29 And he commands them and says to them, “I am being gathered to my people; bury me by my fathers, at the cave which [is] in the field of Ephron the Hittite;
\v 30 in the cave which [is] in the field of Machpelah, which [is] on the front of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place;
\v 31 (there they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah; there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah; and there I buried Leah);
\v 32 the purchase of the field and of the cave which [is] in it, [is] from sons of Heth.”
\v 33 And Jacob finishes commanding his sons, and gathers up his feet to the bed, and expires, and is gathered to his people.
\c 50
\p
\v 1 And Joseph falls on his father’s face, and weeps over him, and kisses him;
\v 2 and Joseph commands his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father, and the physicians embalm Israel;
\v 3 and they fulfill for him forty days, for so they fulfill the days of the embalmed, and the Egyptians weep for him seventy days.
\v 4 And the days of his weeping pass away, and Joseph speaks to the house of Pharaoh, saying, “Now if I have found grace in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
\v 5 My father caused me to swear, saying, Behold, I am dying; in my burying-place which I have prepared for myself in the land of Canaan, there you bury me; and now, please let me go up and bury my father, then I return”;
\v 6 and Pharaoh says, “Go up and bury your father, as he caused you to swear.”
\v 7 And Joseph goes up to bury his father, and all [the] servants of Pharaoh go up with him, [the] elderly of his house, and all [the] elderly of the land of Egypt,
\v 8 and all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and the house of his father; only their infants, and their flock, and their herd, have they left in the land of Goshen;
\v 9 and there go up with him both chariot and horsemen, and the camp is very great.
\v 10 And they come to the threshing-floor of Atad, which [is] beyond the Jordan, and they lament there, a lamentation great and very grievous; and he makes for his father a mourning seven days,
\v 11 and the inhabitant of the land, the Canaanite, sees the mourning in the threshing-floor of Atad and says, “A grievous mourning [is] this to the Egyptians”; therefore [one] has called its name “The mourning of the Egyptians,” which [is] beyond the Jordan.
\v 12 And his sons do to him so as he commanded them,
\v 13 and his sons carry him away to the land of Canaan, and bury him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place, from Ephron the Hittite, on the front of Mamre.
\v 14 And Joseph turns back to Egypt, he and his brothers, and all who are going up with him to bury his father, after his burying his father.
\v 15 And the brothers of Joseph see that their father is dead, and say, “Perhaps Joseph hates us, and certainly returns to us all the evil which we did with him.”
\v 16 And they give a charge for Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded before his death, saying,
\v 17 Thus you say to Joseph: Ah, now, please bear with the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they have done you evil; and now, please bear with the transgression of the servants of the God of your father”; and Joseph weeps in their speaking to him.
\v 18 And his brothers also go and fall before him, and say, “Behold, we [are] to you for servants.”
\v 19 And Joseph says to them, “Do not fear, for [am] I in the place of God?
\v 20 As for you, you devised evil against me, [but] God devised it for good, in order to do as [at] this day, to keep alive a numerous people;
\v 21 and now, do not fear: I nourish you and your infants”; and he comforts them, and speaks to their heart.
\v 22 And Joseph dwells in Egypt, he and the house of his father, and Joseph lives one hundred and ten years,
\v 23 and Joseph looks on Ephraim’s sons of a third [generation]; sons also of Machir, son of Manasseh, have been born on the knees of Joseph.
\v 24 And Joseph says to his brothers, “I am dying, and God certainly inspects you, and has caused you to go up from this land, to the land which He has sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”
\v 25 And Joseph causes the sons of Israel to swear, saying, “God certainly inspects you, and you have brought up my bones from this [place].”
\v 26 And Joseph dies, a son of one hundred and ten years, and they embalm him, and he is put into a coffin in Egypt.
